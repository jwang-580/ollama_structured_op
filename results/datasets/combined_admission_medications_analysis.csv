He had an abdomen/pelvis CT that preliminarily showed gall bladder hypodensity without signs of acute cholecysitis. He was transferred here for ERCP given elevated amylase, lipase and transaminases. AT [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was given 3L IVF for SBP 77-111 with HR 100's with Tm 101.5. He was given tylenol 1gm. He was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] overnight where a right IJ central line was placed and he received 2L NS, IV vancomycin and zosyn. Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for planned ERCP intervention on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].   Past Medical History: CAD s/p stent [**1-6**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] in the setting of pna HTN gout: no active symptoms for several years, does not take ppx ESRD on HD x9 years, ?

History was obtained from ED and husband as patient now intubated.  Per report, she developed shortness of breath over three days and aches throughout her body.  Pain had some radiation to right shoulder and was generally worse in RUQ. No cough or rhinorrhea.  She also endorsed subjective fevers and mild shortness of breath with wheezing at home.  No sick contacts.  Presented to PCP today and was noted to be dyspneic in waiting room, with O2 sats in the low 80s on room air.  She was given ASA 325 mg at clinic. . In the ED, initial CXR showed RLL pneumonia.  Patient was given ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and 2L NS.  Ipratropium and albuterol nebs given.  Refused flu swab but received 75 mg tamiflu. Became more short of breath with desaturations and was then 90% on NRB.  The patient was a very difficult intubation - at least 5 unsuccessful attempts with glidescope; eventually required stat fiberoptic intubation with anesthesia.  Got succ x2 doses, 10 mg vecuronium, etomidate, ativan. On transfer, patient satting 94% on FiO2 1 with PEEP 5. . On arrival to MICU, patient intubated and sedated with residual effects of paralytics.  Given solumedrol 125, mag, vanco 1 gram, and albuterol.

    Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church. She denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence.

    Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church. She denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence.

    Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church. She denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence.

    Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church.

Of note, she also felt lightheaded after dialysis on Monday, which resolved later in the day with rest. She denies any recent medication changes, except for switch to Celexa from Lexapro more than 6 months ago. . This morning, patient had left in the morning around 6am for a nephrology appointment at [**Hospital1 18**]. She felt well upon awakening but had not eaten breakfast. She was sitting in the backseat of the T Ride when she suddenly lost consciousness for [**11-10**] minutes. Her daughter was with her at the time and did not note any head trauma or shaking. Denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling in her arms, palpitations, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath prior to or after the syncope episode. Patient awoke in the ambulance and was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . On review of systems, patient has had TIA x 2 without residual neuro deficits. S/he denies any prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.  Positive for syncope and lightheadedness. . In the ED, initial vitals were HR 70s, BP 90s/50s, AF. EKG on admission showed QT prolongation. Patient had torsades de pointes x 2, lasting < 1 min each and was unresponsive. Prior to torsades, she was eating lunch and felt slightly lightheaded. Central line was placed in R femoral and Mag 5 mg IV was given. Neuro was consulted and felt cause of syncope is unlikely neurogenic given head CT that was negative for bleed and more likely cardiac or from hypoperfusion.  Past Medical History: 1.

    Chief Complaint: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, persistent chest pain, presented from OSH to r/o ACS   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, s/p MI '[**84**], s/p LAD and mid-RCA stent placement in 7/99 with cardiac cath in [**2106-10-12**] which revealed a right-dominant system, LMCA with no angiographically apparent disease, LAD with mild luminal irregularities, patent stents and mid-vessel 50% stenosis, LCx with proximal 50% stenosis, RCA with 90% ostial in-stent restenosis with moderate luminal irregularies, s/p successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA. The cath also revealed normal right-sided filling pressures, low-normal left-sided filling pressures with a depressed cardiac index and elevated systemic vascular resistence. He also has PMH of CHF s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD placed about 9 years ago. He presents to the CCU with acute excerbation of systolic heart failure, persistent chest pain, and r/o ACS from OSH. . At [**Location (un) 11790**] OSH, patient presented with chest pain and was treated with morphine and nitro gtt, which reportedly dropped his SBP to 80s-90s and only converted his chest pain to a [**6-17**] (previously [**11-17**]) and was r/o'd for MI. He was also treated as an acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation and diuresed by IV lasix. At OSH, noted to have U/A with 2+ leukocytes, + nitrites, 80-100 WBC. Today, patient developed substernal chest pressure, diaphoresis, received nitro and morphine which dropped his blood pressure, not given aspirin or heparin.

History was obtained via son, since patient was intubated and unresponsive at time of arrival. Patient was sitting in son's den watching TV today. Son noted that he had to remind his father three times of the names of the teams playing in the game they were watching (MS very strong at baseline). Son left room and then returned to find patient ""blue"" and unresponsive, upright in chair. + urinary incontinance. No stool incontinance. No shaking. Son immediately assisted pt. to floor and began CPR. Pt. rec'd CPR for 5 min. before EMS arrived, at which time he was found by EMS apnic and pulseless and in VFib. Shocked at 200J x 1 --> asystole --> shock 200J times one --> narrow complex tach with pulses. 100mg Lidocaine bolus given followed by Lido drip. Taken to [**Hospital3 **], where he recd Etomidate drip, Succinilcholine, Ativan, Nitro drip, rectal ASA. Pt intubated after multiple attempts (failed intubation in field).  . On arrival to the ED, HR 107 BP 154/90 RR16 100%, intubated. ECG showed no ST segment elevations but atrial fibrillation, LVH and diffuse non-specific ST segment depressions. CXR showed on prelim read wide mediastinum with BL basilar infiltrates and left sided air bronchogram. Pt was given 20.5mg Integrilin bolus followed by 113.6mcg/min, Heparin drip, Lidocaine 2mg/min drip, Plavix 600mg and Metoprolol 10mg IV. . Of note, family reports that patient earlier complained of chest pain this afternoon. Medical history is otherwise unknown, since pt did not seek regular care. .

Her symptoms consisted primarily of subjective fever, fatigue, cough with yellow sputum, and myalgias. She also had nausea and vomited once this AM (minimal amount). She has had relative anorexia with decreased po intake over the past week. She describes her overall constellation of symptoms as similar ot her prior admissions this year. Denies headaches, sore throat, rhinorrhea, or itchy/watery eyes. No chest pain or tightness except when coughing. She does have shortness of breath at baseline though this has worsened over the past week. She is stable able to ambulate her usual distance of bedroom to kitchen without having to stop for SOB. She has been using nebulizers 4-5 times daily which she reports is increased from her baseline. Of note, she lives with her nephew and his wife, both of whom are sick with similar viral syndromes. Today her cough and dyspnea worsened and so she presented to the ED.  In the ED, VS: T 99.7, BP 143/76, HR 114, RR 28, O2sat 94% on 2L. Patient was tachpneic to 30-40's, using accessory muscles, with exam showing wheezing but decent air movement. Peak flow 180cc. Labs showed WBC count of 12.8 (baseline is in teens) with 81% PMN and 2% bands. Lactate was normal at 1.2. Cr was at baseline (1.2). EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic change. CXR was without any acute process. Blood cultures and a flu swab were sent, with no antibiotics given.

She has been using nebulizers 4-5 times daily which she reports is increased from her baseline. Of note, she lives with her nephew and his wife, both of whom are sick with similar viral syndromes. Today her cough and dyspnea worsened and so she presented to the ED.  In the ED, VS: T 99.7, BP 143/76, HR 114, RR 28, O2sat 94% on 2L. Patient was tachpneic to 30-40's, using accessory muscles, with exam showing wheezing but decent air movement. Peak flow 180cc. Labs showed WBC count of 12.8 (baseline is in teens) with 81% PMN and 2% bands. Lactate was normal at 1.2. Cr was at baseline (1.2). EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic change. CXR was without any acute process. Blood cultures and a flu swab were sent, with no antibiotics given. She received 2 rounds of albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, as well as methyprednisolone 125mg. She was given 200cc of IVF and was then admitted to the ICU with VS on transfer of: T 100.4 BP 136/58 HR 125 RR 30-35 Sat: 100% 4L NC.  Currently, patient states she feels better than when she presented and is speaking in full sentences without any accessory muscle use.  Her review of systems is as above, and also notable for chronic bilateral foot numbness.  Past Medical History: 1. Chondrocalcinosis: She has asymmetric polyarthritis involving wrists, MCPs and PIPs.  X-rays showed cartilage calcification on wrists and knees, did not respond to nonsteroidals or colchicine, has been in treatment with low doses of steroids successfully 2. Flexor tendonitis 3. Osteoporosis 4. Asthma and allergies 5. Hypertension 6. Gout 7. History of strongyloides, treated with Ivermectin

Per his son, he was in his USOH last night, and this AM was going to the bathroom with the help of his other son, when he reportedly started to shake and become less responsive. He was helped but to bed where he vomited a small amount, and remained minimally arousable but was breathing. His sons called EMS. He was brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where AVSS, but EKG revealed inferior STEMI with reciprocal ST depressions in AVF and I. as well as V1 and V2.

    Chief Complaint: change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with Percutaneous balloon intervention to Right Coronary Artery   History of Present Illness: 81M with PMH of Alzheimers Dementia, AAA s/p endovascular repair, but no known CAD, who was found by his family to have decreased responsiveness at home this morning. Per his son, he was in his USOH last night, and this AM was going to the bathroom with the help of his other son, when he reportedly started to shake and become less responsive. He was helped but to bed where he vomited a small amount, and remained minimally arousable but was breathing. His sons called EMS. He was brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where AVSS, but EKG revealed inferior STEMI with reciprocal ST depressions in AVF and I. as well as V1 and V2. He received a plavix load, atorvastatin 80mg, ASA 325, and was started on integrillin and heparin bolus + gtts, and was emergently trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. No BB or nitro were given [**1-20**] concern for IMI with RCA involvement. . At cardiac catherization, he was found to have a tortuous supradominant RCA with a thrombus as well as serial lesions. PTCA with thrombectomy was performed, with incidental small dissection of mid-RCA. No stents were able to be deployed. Intra-cath echo showed no percardial effusion. Final angiographic result revealed TIMI 3 flow throughout RCA with less thrombus burden and serial 50-70% lesions in the RCA.   Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: history of tobacco use 2. CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: non -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: none 3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: # Prostate CA s/p distant prostatectomy # ? AAA s/p endovascular repair # ? ""vein grafted in neck"" per son - CEA vs. aneurysm repair

She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61. She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She is being admitted to the CCU for further care. .

She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs).

She has been at [**Hospital **] rehab recovering from a SBO surgery in the spring and has been slowly worsening. She had a seizure 2 weeks ago and was started on Keppra. Two days ago, her keppra dose was decreased for a high peak and somnalence. On [**8-29**], she was febrile to 102.8. She has had continued ventilator requirement.  . In the ED, initial vs were: T 105.4 P 82 BP 96/60 R O2 sat 100. She was hypotensive to 70s/40s from baseline 90s/60s but responded to 2 L IVF. Exam showed unresponsive cachectic woman with warm basilar ralles and cuts in teeth and mouth c/w seizure. Guiac (+) stool. EKG showed new lateral downsloping st depressions. ED doctor discussed code status with son, who confirmed DNR, moving to CMO but wanted a last hurrah. Family did not want a LP because it was too invasive and did not want a CT scan because they did not want any surgeries to correct what might be found. She was given Acetaminophen 650mg x2, Piperacillin-Tazob, Vancomycin 1g, Acyclovir, Aspirin 600mg Supp. Prior to transfer, vitals were HR 77 BP 81/49, RR 33 ovebreathing vent, sat 97% on RR 10, TV 359 PEEP 5, FiO2 40%.

    Chief Complaint: altered mental status, fevers  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: lumbar puncture, PICC  History of Present Illness: 85 year-old female with seizures, CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, presents with fever, hypotension, seizures. She has been at [**Hospital **] rehab recovering from a SBO surgery in the spring and has been slowly worsening. She had a seizure 2 weeks ago and was started on Keppra. Two days ago, her keppra dose was decreased for a high peak and somnalence. On [**8-29**], she was febrile to 102.8. She has had continued ventilator requirement.  . In the ED, initial vs were: T 105.4 P 82 BP 96/60 R O2 sat 100. She was hypotensive to 70s/40s from baseline 90s/60s but responded to 2 L IVF. Exam showed unresponsive cachectic woman with warm basilar ralles and cuts in teeth and mouth c/w seizure. Guiac (+) stool. EKG showed new lateral downsloping st depressions. ED doctor discussed code status with son, who confirmed DNR, moving to CMO but wanted a last hurrah. Family did not want a LP because it was too invasive and did not want a CT scan because they did not want any surgeries to correct what might be found. She was given Acetaminophen 650mg x2, Piperacillin-Tazob, Vancomycin 1g, Acyclovir, Aspirin 600mg Supp. Prior to transfer, vitals were HR 77 BP 81/49, RR 33 ovebreathing vent, sat 97% on RR 10, TV 359 PEEP 5, FiO2 40%.   Past Medical History: Seizure disorder, noted in [**2080**], prior to this episode last seizure in [**2123**], was on dilantin in past but had been taken off.

His wife reports that when she found her husband on the floor, he was awake and alert, but she was unable to lift him, so she called her son, who came over. He was concerned as he stated that his father did not look ""all there"" even though he was awake, so he called the ambulance. At the OSH, the patient was hypoglycemic with a FSG of 40 that resolved with D50. Cardiac enzymes were drawn, demonstrating a troponin of 9.08 with an unconcerning EKG.

    Chief Complaint: weakness, back pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 20113**] is an 87 year old Russian-speaking man with a PMH significant for CAD s/p inferior non-Q wave MI, s/p CVA in [**2171**] with right eye vision loss, DMII, hyperlipidemia, & HTN who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] with 1 day h/o weakness, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever. Via an interpreter, the patient and his family recount that one day prior to admission, the patient was feeling ""weak"" with ""numbness"" in his feet and hands. He had little appetite and did not eat or drink much. Early on the day of admission, the patient was walking to the bathroom with the aid of his walker and felt weak and was unable to support himself so he ""slid"" to the floor. He denies loss of consciousness or injury to his head. He called for his wife, but he does not remember any events after this until he was in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. His wife reports that when she found her husband on the floor, he was awake and alert, but she was unable to lift him, so she called her son, who came over. He was concerned as he stated that his father did not look ""all there"" even though he was awake, so he called the ambulance. At the OSH, the patient was hypoglycemic with a FSG of 40 that resolved with D50. Cardiac enzymes were drawn, demonstrating a troponin of 9.08 with an unconcerning EKG. He received ASA and Plavix before being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. In the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient denied chest pain, but was tachypneic to 25-30 and appeared diaphoretic and felt warm. Initial vitals were:T 100.6 HR 85, BP 148/61, RR 25, O2 Sat 100% on 4L. In addition to the ASA & Plavix, he was then placed on a heparin gtt and given Tylenol for his fever. .

    Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

    Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

    Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

    Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain.

History of Present Illness: This is a 45-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of tonic-clonic seizures (in context of history of head injury and skull fracture 25 years ago) on Lamotrigine, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and anxiety who is transferred from the MICU to the general medicine floor after an acute change in mental status at work and gait instability. . Patient states he has experienced progressive fatigue for the past 6 months.  He developed a headache and ""sinus congestion"" 2 days ago, and began taking OTC medication (sudafed) for nasal stuffiness.  Patient has also been taking herbal supplement (one of which contains lithium) for the past 2 months, which he buys on the internet; patient states that his doctor will no longer refill his prescriptions, as he hasn't been in to see her for a long time. . Patient drove to work on day of admission without any trouble. However, when he got to his office he was found to be increasingly confused and with slurred speech.  He was told to ""go home"" by his boss, but his behavior became increasingly more bizzare (couldn't lift bottle of water to his lips, weak, confused, unbalanced, etc). and EMS was called. . On arrival to the ED, VS were: T97.3, HR 110->95, BP 140/110, RR 16, O2 Sat 100% on 100% NRB.  Patient was found to be somnolent in the ED and neurology was consulted.  Thought that episode was likely due to intoxication from multiple medications, including lithium (in one of the herbal supplements he was taking).  His tox screen was positive for: tricyclics, amphetamine (sudafed), and methadone (possibly from Ultram).  Patient was given ceftriaxone and vanc for presumed meningitis.  An LP was done, which was not consistent with bacterial infection however, patient was continued on acyclovir.  Mr. [**Known lastname 55334**] was intubated for a GCS of [**5-23**] (withdrawal to pain). and transferred to the MICU.  He did well overnight and was extubated the following morning.

History of Present Illness: This is a 45-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of tonic-clonic seizures (in context of history of head injury and skull fracture 25 years ago) on Lamotrigine, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and anxiety who is transferred from the MICU to the general medicine floor after an acute change in mental status at work and gait instability. . Patient states he has experienced progressive fatigue for the past 6 months.  He developed a headache and ""sinus congestion"" 2 days ago, and began taking OTC medication (sudafed) for nasal stuffiness.  Patient has also been taking herbal supplement (one of which contains lithium) for the past 2 months, which he buys on the internet; patient states that his doctor will no longer refill his prescriptions, as he hasn't been in to see her for a long time. . Patient drove to work on day of admission without any trouble. However, when he got to his office he was found to be increasingly confused and with slurred speech.  He was told to ""go home"" by his boss, but his behavior became increasingly more bizzare (couldn't lift bottle of water to his lips, weak, confused, unbalanced, etc). and EMS was called. . On arrival to the ED, VS were: T97.3, HR 110->95, BP 140/110, RR 16, O2 Sat 100% on 100% NRB.  Patient was found to be somnolent in the ED and neurology was consulted.  Thought that episode was likely due to intoxication from multiple medications, including lithium (in one of the herbal supplements he was taking).  His tox screen was positive for: tricyclics, amphetamine (sudafed), and methadone (possibly from Ultram).  Patient was given ceftriaxone and vanc for presumed meningitis.  An LP was done, which was not consistent with bacterial infection however, patient was continued on acyclovir.  Mr. [**Known lastname 55334**] was intubated for a GCS of [**5-23**] (withdrawal to pain). and transferred to the MICU.  He did well overnight and was extubated the following morning.  His lithium level is coming down, and he is being followed by neurology and toxicology.  Vitals on transfer: BP: 124/78, HR: 100, RR: 16, SP02: 99% on RA. . ROS:  As per HPI.  Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain with urination, current fevers or chills.  Past Medical History: - Generalized seizure disorder on lamictal, no recent dose changes.  Patient states that last seizure was a few days prior to arrival and wittnesed by wife.  Normally post-ictal. - Migraines that are temporally related to seizures and started recently after seizure disorder diagnosis made - Anxiety (?) - takes clonazepam prn - HTN - HL - Gout - History of MVA with skull fracture while in his 20s.

Per wife, he was at his USOH until [**10-21**] night, but had temps to 102. Next am, was fine until afternoon, developed rigors.  Has been having gas/intermittent diarrhea on/off for weeks. No abdominal pain/vomiting.  On arrival to OSH his temp was 103 and he was initially normotensive. No leukocytosis, creat 2.4, LFTs wnl, lipase okay, flu negative. Had episode of NBNB emesis. Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.  Got flagyl and levo at OSH, 1L IVfs. En Route to [**Hospital1 18**], reported hypotension/brady, thus on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], got 2L IVFs, BP better since. . Since his transfer blood cultures from the outside hospital became positive with 4/4 bottles growing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report. He has been on Unasyn, he was also found to have [**1-21**] blood cx positive from the ER for Gram+ cocci in clusters, Vanc started (stopped [**10-24**] since CONS). He has been evaluated by surgery and ERCP service [**10-22**]. Had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed concern for possible air vs. stone in the gall bladder, and possible air in the left lobe of the liver. These findings were most concerning for biliary enteric fistula vs. emphysematous cholecystitis, with emphysematous cholecystitis being less likely base on imaging. Was still having fevers on [**10-23**]. Cipro was added for double coverage.  After ERCP consult, it was recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].  Underwent ERCP on [**10-24**] with sphincterotomy, stone fragment extraction, no pus, no fistula. last temp was 103 on am of [**10-24**] (0500) a/w rigors (before ERCP).  .

    Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right great toe amputation  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and hypotension.  The patient reports ""a couple"" of days of feeling generally unwell with malaise and a fever.  He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.  He also endosres some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea. No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He was sent to the ED after his daughter noted him rigoring at rehab and demanded he be sent to the hospital.  In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132/80 R 26 O2 sat 99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.  As the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted regarding management.  The patient was given levofloxacin, acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.  He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.  Overnight the patient was weaned off norepinephrine.  He also defervesced and has been afebrile today.  He received one unit Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.  ID consulted and are recommending daptomycin (patient was on course as an outpatient) and pipercillin-tazobactam as well as discontinuing PICC and scan to r/o abscess.  Plan was for podiatry to amputate toe in AM but patient's daughter and HCP requested vascular to perform this operation so timing is currently unclear.

There was a moderate gradient from left External iliac to right external iliac sheath with the right being about 8mmHG mean greater. This is consistent with mild left inflow disease. Imaging of left leg with patent CFA and Profunda. The SFA had diffuse distal disease with a 3-4cm occlusion. There was reconstitution at Adductor Canal and 3 vessel run off to foot. There was a 90% left AT lesion. Given claudication symptoms with good distal runoff we elected to proceed to intervention. We exchanged for a 6F [**Last Name (un) **] sheath to left CFA. We gave heparin and tried to cross the lesion with multiple wires including Angled Glide, Stiff Angled Glide, V-18, and Straight Glide. We were unable to cross and angiography revealed a perforation with extravasation of dye. At this point further attempts were aborted. We gave protamine to reverse anticoagulation. The patient formed a thigh hematoma which was treated with manual pressure on the right CFA and BP control. She was transferred to CCU for overnight observation. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.

She underwent noninvasive imaging studies of her lower extremities, which demonstrated totally occluded bilateral superficial femoral arteries. She underwent left SFA stenting at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-1-20**] and then presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on this day of admission for right SFA stenting. While in the cath lab, a catheter was introduced into the left femoral artery and wired through to the right SFA when a wire perforation occurred in the right SFA. She developed bleeding into the right thigh. She developed swelling in her right leg with thigh circumference of 52cm compared to left thigh of 46 cm. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills, or rigors. All of the other review of systems were negative. .

    Chief Complaint: gastrocutaneous fistula  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p gastrocuataneous fistula takedown, small bowel resection, and g-tube placment   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] is an unfortunate 32-year-old woman with severe mental retardation due to Rett syndrome. In the remote past she had undergone a Nissen fundoplication with placement of an open gastrostomy tube. She was completely dependent on tube feeding.  She had progressively witnessed widening of her gastrostomy tract until it had become an open fistula with marked breakdown of the surrounding skin. Over the previous 2 months, multiple attempts had been made by the interventional radiology and gastroenterology services to close the opening with noninvasive means including Gelfoam packing. None of these had been successful.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] was to have seen the patient electively to consider surgery, but she instead, entered the hospital via the emergency room with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, with a 10-point decrease her hematocrit requiring transfusion. The effluent through the open gastrostomy was consistent with coffee grounds. She never had bright red blood. She arrived at our hospital on intravenous vancomycin and Zosyn treating an unclear source of presumed infection. She was stated to have a pneumonia, but had a normal chest x-ray and ultimately a normal chest CT scan. We had continued the antibiotics. She had mild elevations of her lipase and amylase which had no correlate on her CT scan. Her gallbladder appeared to be normal, as was the pancreas. In addition, upon arrival she was profoundly dehydrated with a creatinine of 1.9, with a baseline of 0.3. She had been placed on intravenous nutrition 2 months earlier when use of the G-tube was thought to be unwise.  Past Medical History: PMH: Rett syndrome, seizures, osteoporosis, gastrocutaneous fistula PSH: spine surgery, G-tube, s/p Nissen fundoplication

    Chief Complaint: gastrocutaneous fistula  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p gastrocuataneous fistula takedown, small bowel resection, and g-tube placment   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] is an unfortunate 32-year-old woman with severe mental retardation due to Rett syndrome. In the remote past she had undergone a Nissen fundoplication with placement of an open gastrostomy tube. She was completely dependent on tube feeding.  She had progressively witnessed widening of her gastrostomy tract until it had become an open fistula with marked breakdown of the surrounding skin. Over the previous 2 months, multiple attempts had been made by the interventional radiology and gastroenterology services to close the opening with noninvasive means including Gelfoam packing. None of these had been successful.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] was to have seen the patient electively to consider surgery, but she instead, entered the hospital via the emergency room with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, with a 10-point decrease her hematocrit requiring transfusion. The effluent through the open gastrostomy was consistent with coffee grounds. She never had bright red blood. She arrived at our hospital on intravenous vancomycin and Zosyn treating an unclear source of presumed infection. She was stated to have a pneumonia, but had a normal chest x-ray and ultimately a normal chest CT scan. We had continued the antibiotics. She had mild elevations of her lipase and amylase which had no correlate on her CT scan. Her gallbladder appeared to be normal, as was the pancreas. In addition, upon arrival she was profoundly dehydrated with a creatinine of 1.9, with a baseline of 0.3. She had been placed on intravenous nutrition 2 months earlier when use of the G-tube was thought to be unwise.  Past Medical History: PMH: Rett syndrome, seizures, osteoporosis, gastrocutaneous fistula PSH: spine surgery, G-tube, s/p Nissen fundoplication

    Chief Complaint: hematemasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None at [**Hospital1 18**] (EGD at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a  44 year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, Type I diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism, who presents with hematemesis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3924**] was in his usual state of fair-good health until the morning of [**5-8**], when he describes new fatigue and sweating (with heat intolerance) on awakening.  10-20 minutes later, he reports rapid-onset epigastric abdominal pain (5/10 intensity, sharp quality, non-radiating), with 2 episodes of vomiting large 5-10cm blood clots.  At this point, the patient reports feeling mentally ""foggy,"" with moderate dizziness and mild shortness of breath.  EMS was called, and the patient was brought by ambulance to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital ([**Hospital1 189**]).  The patient reports two episodes of nosebleed over the past week (compared to no bleeding at baseline).  He reports his last drink ([**2-20**] shots whisky) was on the night prior to the present episode.  He denies loss of conciousness, tremor, itchiness, hematochezia, melena, changes in vision or hearing, previous episodes of hematemesis, recent abdominal pain, or recent history of vomiting. . At the OSH, the patient vomited copious amounts of bright red blood (""filling [**3-21**] vomit bags"").  SBP was down to 80-90s, with HCT 33 and glucose 450.  Stool was guaiac + .  He received fluids, 2 units packed RBCs, protonix IV q12, ciprofloxacin, octrotide, vit K, and humalog (10 units x2).  An EGD revealed esophageal varices (grade 4).  Variceal banding was performed, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-9**] for further management. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the patient had T 36.4 P 72 BP 83-103/62 RR 16 SaO2 94 % (RA), with one initial episode of nausea and small coffee-ground emesis.  Hct was 32.4 on admission (low of 25.8). He was observed for --- hours, found to be hemodynamically stable, and transferred to the floor. . On the floor, the patient reports good appetite, with no residual nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, or fatigue.  Hct was up from 25.8 to 28.  He denies further vomiting episodes. . . ROS: The patient reports a new-onset sore throat on [**5-7**] (two days prior to presentation), with swollen glands.  He denies new onset nausea/vomiting.

    Chief Complaint: BRBPR after colonoscopy with polypectomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 66 y/o M with PMHx of Atrial Fib who went for colonoscopy on [**8-29**] after holding coumadin for 3 days prior to procedure and underwent three polypectomies-proximal transverse, distal transverse, and cecum. On [**2125-8-30**], pt noted some crampy lower abdominal pain when he awoke and noticed a small amount of blood in BMs. Pt went to work but was concerned with the continued BRBPR approx 4 episodes. Pt reportes feeling dizzy when he saw the blood in the toilet, but denied any syncope or presyncope. Pt initially presented to [**Hospital Ward Name **], thinking it was the ED and medical emergency was called. Pt was found with blood on seat of pants & e/o incontinence. . Pt was transferred directly to the ED where initial VS 96.7 HR 90 BP 117/70 RR 16 and Sats 97% on RA. Hct was down from 54 in [**3-17**] to 39.1.  Pt received 2L of NS but did not receive any blood products overnight and am HCT was down at 29.7. Pt had an episode of BRBPR on the floor and became tachy to 140s. Decision was made for transfer to ICU and per GI recs, pt had already begun taking Golytely prep. . On arrival to ICU, pt was anxious but denying any CP/SOB/Abd pain or nausea.  He had already taken approx half of the golytely prep and was complaining of chills. . ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematemesis, shortness of breath, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria.

    Chief Complaint: Syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2139-7-6**] Endoscopy with banding of esophageal varices   History of Present Illness: 48-year-old gentleman with hepatocellular versus intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with massive disease progression on reduced dose sorafenib therapy comes in with syncope and coffee ground emesis. UGIB, NG lavage cleared after 1 liter. 20 point hematocrit drop, hematocrit 16.7 from 35. WBC 22. Negative cardiac enzymes. 2 units blood, 4 liters of fluid. Vanco/levo/flagyl. Liver fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they plan on scoping him early this morning.  CT abd/pelvis prelim read shows advanced, infiltrative HCC with unchanged occulssion right portal vein seen on [**6-8**] scan, increase in ascites now moderate to large in volume. Diffuse hyperenhancement of small bowel wall which may reflect ischemia related to GIB, small perf cannot be excluded.

His liver function tests were abnormal. Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a 7.3 x 6.4 x 9 cm mass in the right lobe of the liver, extending in to the left lobe.  [**1-/2138**], a biopsy was performed, which revealed a neuroendocrine carcinoma positive for CK7 and 20, chromogranins and synaptophysin and S-100.  In [**2-/2138**], a CT scan showed the mass was enlarging and causing biliary obstruction.  He had a negative octreotide scan at that time.  However, on [**2138-3-19**] an AFP was over 3000.  On [**2138-3-28**] he had an exploratory laparotomy and nodule biopsy along with intraoperative ultrasound which suggested that the carcinoma was unresectable. Since that time he has had seven cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin as well as sorafenib who has continued to have disease progression on those therapies.  .

History of Present Illness: 72 y/o M with h/o STEMI '[**82**] s/p BMS x 2 to mid-LAD who presented to OSH with chest pain.  Patient awoke from his sleep at approx 11pm [**12-14**] with 10/10 chest pain that prompted him to seek EMS. Patient describes as a pressure across his chest with radiation to both of his arms.  Reports associated SOB, Nausea and states that presentation is similar to his STEMI in [**2182**].  Patient's initial vitals at OSH were BP 148/100, HR 94, 99%RA. Patient was found to have anterior ST elevations on ECG and was given ASA 325mg, plavix loaded, and started on NTG and Eptifibatide gtts.  Patient's nausea was controlled with zofran, and given lopressor 5mg IV x 1.   The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  On transfer, patient's BP was 124/74 on NTG gtt.  Patient was not started on heparin gtt at OSH as there was concern for widened mediastinum.  During cardiac catheterization, patient was found to have proximal mid-LAD late stent thrombosis.  Patient had thrombectomy and had [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 placed overlapping prior proximal BMS.  D1 with 70% lesion, distal 50% LAD lesion that appears old.

She was at home with her husband, who noted on morning of admission she was much less responsive than usual, and that she felt warm to the touch. He describes that she was slightly more somnolent the day prior to admission. He was concerned and called EMS. She was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**]. There, she was noted to have a white blood cell count of 26 with bands, a total bilirubin of 2.4, no acute chest process on chest x-ray, and a mildly positive urine analysis with 1+ LE. She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl over concern of cholangitis. Her INR was over 8, and she was given 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K.

The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive of clear to white sputum.  Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports he was able to walk approximately 100feet before becoming short of breath.  He does report at times he has felt lightheaded, however has never lost consciousness.  He reports this episode was very similar to when he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  He denies any orthopnea or PND.  He denies any chest pain or palpitations.  EMS gave the patient diltiazem en route to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER as his rate was in the 180's.   In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.  Cardiology was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.  After this treatment, the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 80's systolic. The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still in the ER.  He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and continued on a drip following.   On admission to the floor, the patient was continued on this regimen.  DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  At this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was discontinued.  The patient was also found to be febrile, have leukocytosis and productive cough.  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP, however this was discontinued prior to transfer.  On transfer, the patient's HR was in the 170's, but normotensive.  On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

    Chief Complaint: A fib with RVR, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE ICU monitoring   History of Present Illness: 52 yo male with history of a fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of A fib with RVR in the setting of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive of clear to white sputum.  Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports he was able to walk approximately 100feet before becoming short of breath.  He does report at times he has felt lightheaded, however has never lost consciousness.  He reports this episode was very similar to when he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  He denies any orthopnea or PND.  He denies any chest pain or palpitations.  EMS gave the patient diltiazem en route to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER as his rate was in the 180's.   In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.  Cardiology was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.  After this treatment, the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 80's systolic. The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still in the ER.  He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and continued on a drip following.   On admission to the floor, the patient was continued on this regimen.  DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  At this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was discontinued.  The patient was also found to be febrile, have leukocytosis and productive cough.  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP, however this was discontinued prior to transfer.  On transfer, the patient's HR was in the 170's, but normotensive.  On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

    Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, CHF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 34850**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, s/p CVA who presented to [**Hospital 11373**] on [**2185-3-2**] with heart failure exacerbation and atrial fibrillation with RVR. He presented with a one week history of increased dyspnea on exertion, PND, 3 pillow orthopnea and decreased exercise tolerance. Prior to presentation to the hospital he was unable to transfer from his bed without marked SOB. At [**Location (un) **], BNP was noted to be elevated and CXR showed increased interstitial markings. He was seen by Cardiology consult service who recommended rule out for MI, repeat echo, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. He was diuresed and for his AF initially started on a diltiazem gtt and then converted to Metoprolol 25mg q6H to treat his heart rate. At some point during the hospitalization he was started on amiodarone and cardioverted. He was reportedly hypotensive on [**3-5**] and therefore the consulting cardiologist requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. . He was also noted to be in acute renal failure with increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1 attributed to treatment with lasix, ACE and beta blocker. He was treated with Duonebs for COPD. . On [**2185-2-4**] the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] for chest pain. He was found to be in 2nd degree heart block attributed to medications. His digoxin was stopped at that time. He required intubation transiently. He ruled out for MI. During that admission he was diuresed, treated with low dose beta blocker, ACE and diuretics and was started on amiodarone for HR control. . On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable. He is oxygenating well on 2L NC. He is in sinus rhythm. .   Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation on coumadin s/p CVA with minimal left sided weakness - [**2179-10-9**] Congestive heart failure, EF 40% CAD - negative nuclear study in [**2181**]. No history of MI. Last cath 4 years ago. COPD Peripheral vascular disease Peptic ulcer disease Dyslipidemia Anxiety Depression Hypertension Chronic pain syndrome

    Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, CHF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 34850**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, s/p CVA who presented to [**Hospital 11373**] on [**2185-3-2**] with heart failure exacerbation and atrial fibrillation with RVR. He presented with a one week history of increased dyspnea on exertion, PND, 3 pillow orthopnea and decreased exercise tolerance. Prior to presentation to the hospital he was unable to transfer from his bed without marked SOB. At [**Location (un) **], BNP was noted to be elevated and CXR showed increased interstitial markings. He was seen by Cardiology consult service who recommended rule out for MI, repeat echo, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. He was diuresed and for his AF initially started on a diltiazem gtt and then converted to Metoprolol 25mg q6H to treat his heart rate. At some point during the hospitalization he was started on amiodarone and cardioverted. He was reportedly hypotensive on [**3-5**] and therefore the consulting cardiologist requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. . He was also noted to be in acute renal failure with increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1 attributed to treatment with lasix, ACE and beta blocker. He was treated with Duonebs for COPD. . On [**2185-2-4**] the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] for chest pain. He was found to be in 2nd degree heart block attributed to medications. His digoxin was stopped at that time. He required intubation transiently. He ruled out for MI. During that admission he was diuresed, treated with low dose beta blocker, ACE and diuretics and was started on amiodarone for HR control. . On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable. He is oxygenating well on 2L NC. He is in sinus rhythm. .   Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation on coumadin s/p CVA with minimal left sided weakness - [**2179-10-9**] Congestive heart failure, EF 40% CAD - negative nuclear study in [**2181**].

    Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, CHF  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 34850**] is a 58 year old male with history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, s/p CVA who presented to [**Hospital 11373**] on [**2185-3-2**] with heart failure exacerbation and atrial fibrillation with RVR. He presented with a one week history of increased dyspnea on exertion, PND, 3 pillow orthopnea and decreased exercise tolerance. Prior to presentation to the hospital he was unable to transfer from his bed without marked SOB. At [**Location (un) **], BNP was noted to be elevated and CXR showed increased interstitial markings. He was seen by Cardiology consult service who recommended rule out for MI, repeat echo, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. He was diuresed and for his AF initially started on a diltiazem gtt and then converted to Metoprolol 25mg q6H to treat his heart rate. At some point during the hospitalization he was started on amiodarone and cardioverted. He was reportedly hypotensive on [**3-5**] and therefore the consulting cardiologist requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. . He was also noted to be in acute renal failure with increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1 attributed to treatment with lasix, ACE and beta blocker. He was treated with Duonebs for COPD. . On [**2185-2-4**] the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] for chest pain. He was found to be in 2nd degree heart block attributed to medications. His digoxin was stopped at that time. He required intubation transiently. He ruled out for MI. During that admission he was diuresed, treated with low dose beta blocker, ACE and diuretics and was started on amiodarone for HR control. . On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable. He is oxygenating well on 2L NC. He is in sinus rhythm. .

Subsequently on [**12-5**] he had a hypoxic event and a diagnosis of PE was made; which required intubation. Since that time he has required AC ventilation with requirements of FIO2 80%/PEEP 5. Of note, this hypoxic event was felt to be extensive and patients neurologic status has not improved since. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab on the ventilation while on heparin & today was transferred back to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] for evaluation for Trach/PEG. He was noted to have BRBPR, a hct was 22 (down from 27). PTT>150. He was given 1U prbcs and per report an EGD was done with no source of bleeding. The GI service felt pt would benefit from arteriogram with vasopressin adminstration; he was given peripheral vasopressin he was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GIB plus evaluation for trach/peg.   Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI [**2111**] and [**2114**]; most recent MI accompanied by cardiac arrest; tx medically with Sotalol Lumbar stenosis s/p lumbar surgery Polymyalgia Rheumatica s/p CCY Hyperlipidemia DJD COPD- 3 ppd history

Over the last two weeks, she has experienced blurry vision. She also noted increased frequency of urination, thirst, and increased appetite as she was always hungry. She also noted white spots in her mouth and vaginal itching consistent with a yeast infection. . She presented this evening to the emergency room for further management of blurred vision, thrush, and left-sided chest discomfort.

    Chief Complaint: Blurry vision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: insulin drip   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year old female with past medical history of sarcoidosis who presented with blurred vision. . Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily for her sarcoidosis about two weeks ago on [**2-9**]/3009, and has been tapered down to 20 mg. Over the last two weeks, she has experienced blurry vision. She also noted increased frequency of urination, thirst, and increased appetite as she was always hungry. She also noted white spots in her mouth and vaginal itching consistent with a yeast infection. . She presented this evening to the emergency room for further management of blurred vision, thrush, and left-sided chest discomfort. Her initial vital signs were: pain of [**7-13**], temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 76, blood pressure 136/95, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. A finger stick was checked and discovered to be critically high. She was given two liters of intravenous fluids and a 10 unit bolus of insulin, however a finger stick remained critically high, so she was started on an insulin drip which was reported to be at 7 units per hour at time of transfer with a finger stick still critically high. Her examination in the ED was notable for thrush, as well as visual acuity of 20/70 on the right, 20/50 on the left, and 20/70 both eyes. A chest x-ray was unremarkable. She was given a total of 4 liters of IVF prior to transfer. . Upon transfer to the ICU, she reports she feels better. She denies any pain or complaints at present aside from some left sided breast/axilla pain. . In the ICU she was on an insulin gtt then transitioned to SQ insulin lantus and SSI.

    Chief Complaint: Hypotension, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from [**Hospital3 105**] with actinobacter growing in his blood. He has a history of line infections from his left groin HD line and was recently discharged on [**2127-1-8**] after a course of vanc. At [**Hospital3 105**], it is unclear why the blood culture was drawn in the first place and there is no paperwork accompanying the patient. The call-in to the ED reports that the actinobacter was sensitive to bactrim and unasyn. One dose of Unasyn was given and he was then transferred to the ED. . In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114/60, 17, 100%RA. He remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then admitted to medicine for further care. . On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, n/v/d. He reported that he has been passing gas. He refused an NGT. On routine vitals, he was noted to be unresponsive to sternal rub. No blood pressure was able to be obtained so a code blue was called. He was given an amp of epi for PEA and CPR was started but he pushed people off of him. He was started on levophed and a L arterial line was placed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. . On arrival to the ICU he was still somnolent and not following commands and not able to answer questions. He was intubated for airway protection. His R tunnelled HD cath was accessed as he only had a L PICC. He was listed as DNR/DNI on prior d/c summary but his HCP wishes him to be full code at this point.   Past Medical History: 1) HIV: diagnosed in [**2106**], on HAART. followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. 2) Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, charcot foot, nephropathy, and ? mild retinopathy. 2) Chronic renal failure on Hemodialysis and graft infections, thrombus: dx approx.

    Chief Complaint: Hypotension, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from [**Hospital3 105**] with actinobacter growing in his blood. He has a history of line infections from his left groin HD line and was recently discharged on [**2127-1-8**] after a course of vanc. At [**Hospital3 105**], it is unclear why the blood culture was drawn in the first place and there is no paperwork accompanying the patient. The call-in to the ED reports that the actinobacter was sensitive to bactrim and unasyn. One dose of Unasyn was given and he was then transferred to the ED. . In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114/60, 17, 100%RA. He remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then admitted to medicine for further care. . On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, n/v/d. He reported that he has been passing gas. He refused an NGT. On routine vitals, he was noted to be unresponsive to sternal rub. No blood pressure was able to be obtained so a code blue was called. He was given an amp of epi for PEA and CPR was started but he pushed people off of him. He was started on levophed and a L arterial line was placed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. . On arrival to the ICU he was still somnolent and not following commands and not able to answer questions. He was intubated for airway protection. His R tunnelled HD cath was accessed as he only had a L PICC. He was listed as DNR/DNI on prior d/c summary but his HCP wishes him to be full code at this point.   Past Medical History: 1) HIV: diagnosed in [**2106**], on HAART. followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. 2) Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, charcot foot, nephropathy, and ? mild retinopathy. 2) Chronic renal failure on Hemodialysis and graft infections, thrombus: dx approx.

    Chief Complaint: Hypotension, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from [**Hospital3 105**] with actinobacter growing in his blood. He has a history of line infections from his left groin HD line and was recently discharged on [**2127-1-8**] after a course of vanc. At [**Hospital3 105**], it is unclear why the blood culture was drawn in the first place and there is no paperwork accompanying the patient. The call-in to the ED reports that the actinobacter was sensitive to bactrim and unasyn. One dose of Unasyn was given and he was then transferred to the ED. . In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114/60, 17, 100%RA. He remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then admitted to medicine for further care. . On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, n/v/d. He reported that he has been passing gas. He refused an NGT. On routine vitals, he was noted to be unresponsive to sternal rub. No blood pressure was able to be obtained so a code blue was called. He was given an amp of epi for PEA and CPR was started but he pushed people off of him. He was started on levophed and a L arterial line was placed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. . On arrival to the ICU he was still somnolent and not following commands and not able to answer questions. He was intubated for airway protection. His R tunnelled HD cath was accessed as he only had a L PICC. He was listed as DNR/DNI on prior d/c summary but his HCP wishes him to be full code at this point.   Past Medical History: 1) HIV: diagnosed in [**2106**], on HAART. followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. 2) Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, charcot foot, nephropathy, and ? mild retinopathy. 2) Chronic renal failure on Hemodialysis and graft infections, thrombus: dx approx.

    Chief Complaint: Hypotension, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: mechanical ventilation   History of Present Illness: 65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from [**Hospital3 105**] with actinobacter growing in his blood. He has a history of line infections from his left groin HD line and was recently discharged on [**2127-1-8**] after a course of vanc. At [**Hospital3 105**], it is unclear why the blood culture was drawn in the first place and there is no paperwork accompanying the patient. The call-in to the ED reports that the actinobacter was sensitive to bactrim and unasyn. One dose of Unasyn was given and he was then transferred to the ED. . In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114/60, 17, 100%RA. He remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then admitted to medicine for further care. . On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, n/v/d. He reported that he has been passing gas. He refused an NGT. On routine vitals, he was noted to be unresponsive to sternal rub. No blood pressure was able to be obtained so a code blue was called. He was given an amp of epi for PEA and CPR was started but he pushed people off of him. He was started on levophed and a L arterial line was placed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. . On arrival to the ICU he was still somnolent and not following commands and not able to answer questions. He was intubated for airway protection. His R tunnelled HD cath was accessed as he only had a L PICC. He was listed as DNR/DNI on prior d/c summary but his HCP wishes him to be full code at this point.   Past Medical History: 1) HIV: diagnosed in [**2106**], on HAART. followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. 2) Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, charcot foot, nephropathy, and ? mild retinopathy. 2) Chronic renal failure on Hemodialysis and graft infections, thrombus: dx approx.

Transferred to the unit for hypotension versus septic shock. . Unfortunately pt is a poor historian. Pt was diagnosed with a UTI and started on Augementin on [**2148-2-6**] which she completed a 10 day course. Per pt's PCA they were at Foxwood yesterday, pt had no symptoms when she went to bed last night at 8pm. Her PCA stayed with her last night when the pt had acute onset of SOB at midnight. Her O2 sat which was noted to be 77%, she was placed on 4l of oxygen and her saturation improved to 93%. Her PCA called [**Company 191**] and was referred to the ED. Pt has home oxygen which she uses only when she is discharged from the hospital with PNA.  . She denies any cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis, expectorant. + chills. .

A CTA was obtsined which showed no P. Embolism but did show bibasilar consolidation which were thought to be possible chronic atelectasis. Pt was originally on her way to the medicine floor when she was hypotensive to with systolics in the 80s asymptomatic. Pt was given 3-4 litres of fluid, lactate was obtained and normal. BP prior to transfer was increased to 90/60. . Of note she was recently discharged on [**2148-1-3**] with a similar presentation.

As recently as [**2138-11-9**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seeing pts as a psychiatrist after finishing five months of chemotherapy for lymphoma. His wife notes some paraphasic errors in his speech and difficulties with abstraction over the past year, but not major cognitive deficits. He was able to walk with a cane, but had progressively worsening gait from neuropathy secondary to diabetes and vincristine. In late [**Month (only) **], he fell four times in one week and felt significantly weaker so his PCP advised him to seek medical attention. He was hospitalized [**Date range (2) 95199**].
