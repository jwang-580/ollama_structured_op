        Chief Complaint:  Sigmoid diverticulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, pelvic drain placement, diverting loop ileostomy. 1.Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy . 2.Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, placement of packs and drains with planned take-back . 3.Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, removal of the intra-abdominal packs, temporary abdominal closure with [**State 19827**] patch. . 4.Closure of abdominal incision.   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 43-year-old gentleman with multiple attacks of diverticulitis. The first attack was in [**2186-8-24**], the second was in [**2188-1-24**]. He had a colonoscopy in [**2188-8-23**] which showed moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and was otherwise normal. He had a CT scan which confirmed mild diverticulitis. He is now having recurrent attacks of left lower quadrant pain and left lower back pain every 6-8 months. He takes Cipro and Flagyl for 10 days and it is taking longer and longer for the episodes to resolve with antibiotics. He is currently asymptomatic and he  presents for laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis.

He was reportedly sitting in a chair and was completely unresponsive. When EMS arrived they found him unresponsive and non-verbal but with stable vital signs.  He was given 0.4mg naloxone with no response. On route to the hospital he vomited a small amount.  In the ED he was unresponsive but was moving his head around. His vital signs in the ED were T 98.8 HR 88, BP 124/66 RR 11 saturating at 97% on room air. Ct head and spine were unremarkable. Chest xray was also unremarkable. Urine tox was positive for opiates.  Serum tox was negative. UA was negative for leukocytes and nitrites; WBC [**11-28**], large blood, RBC negative. Patient had a leukocytosis with a WBC of 22. He was given 1 dose of vancomycin. His creatinine was elevated to 8.9 (baseline 0.8) and he had a potassium of 6.3 with peaked T waves. Patient was given bicarb, insulin, and glucose and his potassium decreased to 5.1.  No kayexelate was given due to patient's altered mental status.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended rehydration at 125cc/hr, potassium checks, renal US with doppler, and PTH level. Patient was given a total of 2L NS in the ED and then admitted to the intensive care unit where he was moving all four extremities but only rarely followed commands and was not reliably responsive to voice.

He was reportedly sitting in a chair and was completely unresponsive. When EMS arrived they found him unresponsive and non-verbal but with stable vital signs.  He was given 0.4mg naloxone with no response. On route to the hospital he vomited a small amount.  In the ED he was unresponsive but was moving his head around. His vital signs in the ED were T 98.8 HR 88, BP 124/66 RR 11 saturating at 97% on room air. Ct head and spine were unremarkable. Chest xray was also unremarkable. Urine tox was positive for opiates.  Serum tox was negative. UA was negative for leukocytes and nitrites; WBC [**11-28**], large blood, RBC negative. Patient had a leukocytosis with a WBC of 22. He was given 1 dose of vancomycin. His creatinine was elevated to 8.9 (baseline 0.8) and he had a potassium of 6.3 with peaked T waves. Patient was given bicarb, insulin, and glucose and his potassium decreased to 5.1.  No kayexelate was given due to patient's altered mental status.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended rehydration at 125cc/hr, potassium checks, renal US with doppler, and PTH level. Patient was given a total of 2L NS in the ED and then admitted to the intensive care unit where he was moving all four extremities but only rarely followed commands and was not reliably responsive to voice.

He was reportedly sitting in a chair and was completely unresponsive. When EMS arrived they found him unresponsive and non-verbal but with stable vital signs.  He was given 0.4mg naloxone with no response. On route to the hospital he vomited a small amount.  In the ED he was unresponsive but was moving his head around. His vital signs in the ED were T 98.8 HR 88, BP 124/66 RR 11 saturating at 97% on room air. Ct head and spine were unremarkable. Chest xray was also unremarkable. Urine tox was positive for opiates.  Serum tox was negative. UA was negative for leukocytes and nitrites; WBC [**11-28**], large blood, RBC negative. Patient had a leukocytosis with a WBC of 22. He was given 1 dose of vancomycin. His creatinine was elevated to 8.9 (baseline 0.8) and he had a potassium of 6.3 with peaked T waves. Patient was given bicarb, insulin, and glucose and his potassium decreased to 5.1.  No kayexelate was given due to patient's altered mental status.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended rehydration at 125cc/hr, potassium checks, renal US with doppler, and PTH level.

Per discussion with patient and daughter, she had had some stomach upset earlier this morning and cold symptoms prior to HD. No fever, chills, LH, dizziness, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, urinary symptoms. At HD, she had a fever to 102.8, malaise, respiratory distress. Also had an episode of emesis at HD. Unclear whether she finished her HD treatment today. Blood cultures were drawn at HD, she was given 1g vanco, tylenol, and transferred to the ED.  In the ED, initial vitals were T 102.8, BP 142/64, HR 87, RR 16, SaO2 95% on 2L. While in the ED, she spiked to a Tmax of 104. Remained HD stable. She was given 2L NS, tylenol for fever, zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage. Given that she is on chronic steroids, the ED gave her 100mg IV hydrocortisone. There was also concern for PE, given her history of PE as well as her tachypnea and hypoxia. Pt also developed severe R flank pain and was given morphine 2mg IV x 2. She was started on a heparin drip with the plan to get a VQ scan on the floor. Admitted to the MICU for closer monitoring.  On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of feeling very tired and having severe [**6-2**] pain at her R back/flank. She has never had pain like this before.

        Chief Complaint: RUQ abdominal pain Reason for MICU admission: respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: fiberoptic intubation with anesthesia PICC line placement Arterial line placement IJ central venous catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is a 70yo female, with DM, HTN, and asthma, who presented to the ED with RUQ abdominal pain, and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.  History was obtained from ED and husband as patient now intubated.  Per report, she developed shortness of breath over three days and aches throughout her body.  Pain had some radiation to right shoulder and was generally worse in RUQ. No cough or rhinorrhea.  She also endorsed subjective fevers and mild shortness of breath with wheezing at home.  No sick contacts.  Presented to PCP today and was noted to be dyspneic in waiting room, with O2 sats in the low 80s on room air.  She was given ASA 325 mg at clinic. . In the ED, initial CXR showed RLL pneumonia.  Patient was given ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and 2L NS.  Ipratropium and albuterol nebs given.  Refused flu swab but received 75 mg tamiflu. Became more short of breath with desaturations and was then 90% on NRB.  The patient was a very difficult intubation - at least 5 unsuccessful attempts with glidescope; eventually required stat fiberoptic intubation with anesthesia.  Got succ x2 doses, 10 mg vecuronium, etomidate, ativan. On transfer, patient satting 94% on FiO2 1 with PEEP 5. . On arrival to MICU, patient intubated and sedated with residual effects of paralytics.  Given solumedrol 125, mag, vanco 1 gram, and albuterol.  Past Medical History: - Diabetes Type II - Hypertension - Asthma: O2 sats at baseline low 90s on RA - Hypertriglyceridemia

She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church. She denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence.

        Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.   It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church. She denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence.

She had been in her usual state of health until she began having syncopal episodes about 1.5 weeks ago. Prior to today, she has had 2 episodes of passing out for a few seconds, once at home and once at her son's. Of note, she also felt lightheaded after dialysis on Monday, which resolved later in the day with rest. She denies any recent medication changes, except for switch to Celexa from Lexapro more than 6 months ago. . This morning, patient had left in the morning around 6am for a nephrology appointment at [**Hospital1 18**]. She felt well upon awakening but had not eaten breakfast. She was sitting in the backseat of the T Ride when she suddenly lost consciousness for [**11-10**] minutes. Her daughter was with her at the time and did not note any head trauma or shaking. Denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling in her arms, palpitations, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath prior to or after the syncope episode. Patient awoke in the ambulance and was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. . On review of systems, patient has had TIA x 2 without residual neuro deficits. S/he denies any prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. . Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.  Positive for syncope and lightheadedness. . In the ED, initial vitals were HR 70s, BP 90s/50s, AF. EKG on admission showed QT prolongation. Patient had torsades de pointes x 2, lasting < 1 min each and was unresponsive. Prior to torsades, she was eating lunch and felt slightly lightheaded. Central line was placed in R femoral and Mag 5 mg IV was given. Neuro was consulted and felt cause of syncope is unlikely neurogenic given head CT that was negative for bleed and more likely cardiac or from hypoperfusion.  Past Medical History: 1.

        Chief Complaint: hypoxia and hypercarbia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 49 year old male with a PMH of HTN, DMII, OSA, COPD, CAD s/p IMI and stenting who presents with increasing shortness of breath, dizzyness, and bilateral lower extremity swelling over the past 2 weeks. The patient felt like he was fighting a cold 2 weeks ago and took Airborne. His symptoms improved, but then he developed a runny nose and post nasal drainage and began coughing grey-[**Known lastname **] sputum from his lungs. His dyspnea occurs primarilly with movement/exertion, not at rest. Over this time period he has also developed worsening bilateral lower extremity edema that has been painful at times at the ankles. He denies any prior history of lower extremity edema. He has also been waking up at night sitting up on the side of his bed with his CPAP mask off and feeling somewhat confused. He has had a decreased appetite for the last 3-4 days with decreased PO intake. He has also felt ""dizzy"" and when asked to clarify this states that he has felt lightheaded, as if he would faint, at times. . He presented to the [**Hospital 191**] clinic earlier today and was noted to have a heart rate of 120 with an 02 sat of 78%. He was sent to the ED for further evaluation. Vitals on presentation to the ED were T 99.1, BP 136/90, HR 100, O2sat of 92% 2L. He received aspirin 325 mg PO, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Lasix 10 mg IV. On initial presentation on the floor, the patient was comfortable, in no distress, able speak and relate history easily, 92%4L. On falling asleep w/o his usual home BiPap w/ 3L, he desaturated to 78%RA. He was triggered due to hypoxia. On arousing the patient up, the patient was awake, alert, not complaining of SOB, but drowsy. Initially, his O2 sat rose to 89% on 4L. Respiratory therapy was called to arrange for patient's BiPap. He was also given lasix 20mg IV to which he promptly urinated 650cc. He also received a combivent. His clinical status continued to deteriorate with 02 sat 80-85% on 10L. ABG was 7.42/90/45. He was placed on CPAP and transfered to the ICU. . ROS: As above. In addition he also endorses diarrhea yesterday only that has since resolved. He chronically sleeps on 2 pillows at night and has to sleep on his left side as he cannot breathe if he lays on his back. He also uses CPAP at night. He has had no fevers, chills, vertigo, headache, chest pain, melena, BRBPR, myalgias, arthralgias, or dysuria.

        Chief Complaint: flu-like symptoms x 1 week  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old Spanish speaking female with history of chondrocalcinosis on chronic prednisone, asthma (admissions x 2 this year for exacerbation tx'ed with steroids and antibiotics, never intubated), and bronchiectasis who presents with an URI-like symptoms over the past week. Her symptoms consisted primarily of subjective fever, fatigue, cough with yellow sputum, and myalgias. She also had nausea and vomited once this AM (minimal amount). She has had relative anorexia with decreased po intake over the past week. She describes her overall constellation of symptoms as similar ot her prior admissions this year. Denies headaches, sore throat, rhinorrhea, or itchy/watery eyes. No chest pain or tightness except when coughing. She does have shortness of breath at baseline though this has worsened over the past week. She is stable able to ambulate her usual distance of bedroom to kitchen without having to stop for SOB. She has been using nebulizers 4-5 times daily which she reports is increased from her baseline. Of note, she lives with her nephew and his wife, both of whom are sick with similar viral syndromes. Today her cough and dyspnea worsened and so she presented to the ED.  In the ED, VS: T 99.7, BP 143/76, HR 114, RR 28, O2sat 94% on 2L. Patient was tachpneic to 30-40's, using accessory muscles, with exam showing wheezing but decent air movement. Peak flow 180cc. Labs showed WBC count of 12.8 (baseline is in teens) with 81% PMN and 2% bands. Lactate was normal at 1.2. Cr was at baseline (1.2). EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic change. CXR was without any acute process. Blood cultures and a flu swab were sent, with no antibiotics given. She received 2 rounds of albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, as well as methyprednisolone 125mg. She was given 200cc of IVF and was then admitted to the ICU with VS on transfer of: T 100.4 BP 136/58 HR 125 RR 30-35 Sat: 100% 4L NC.  Currently, patient states she feels better than when she presented and is speaking in full sentences without any accessory muscle use.  Her review of systems is as above, and also notable for chronic bilateral foot numbness.  Past Medical History: 1. Chondrocalcinosis: She has asymmetric polyarthritis involving wrists, MCPs and PIPs.  X-rays showed cartilage calcification on wrists and knees, did not respond to nonsteroidals or colchicine, has been in treatment with low doses of steroids successfully 2. Flexor tendonitis 3.

On the evening prior to admission she developed nausea and vomiting.  According to ED notes, she denied fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  She presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . On presentation to the ED, the patient's vital signs were T 98.6, BP 189/92, HR 109, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA.  She appeared well initially however she developed rigors with temperature to 104.5, HR 156, BP 180/110.  During the episode she became more sedated but still responding to commands.  She was given tylenol, vancomycin 1g x1 and unasyn 3g IV x1.  Hemodynamics improved with these interventions however she had a second episode shortly thereafter.  Again she became tachycardic (HR 155), hypertensive (198/101) and T 105.  She was intubated for airway protection.  Labs were notable for WBC count elevated to 17.2, 2% bands, then subsequently was low at 3.7 with 16% bands.  Lactate on admission was 6.1, improved to 3.3 after hydration. UA was positive.  LFTs within normal limits.  CT abdomen showed L>R perinephric fat stranding and wedge shaped density c/w pyelo.  She was given 6L IVF.  CXR done post intubation showed vascular engorgement and low lying endotracheal tube.  Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] BPs noted to be systolic 80s, a right subclavian was placed.  She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment of urosepsis. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated and sedated. Her BP was systolic 80s, HR 120s on arrival.  Levophed was started.  She was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and given 1L NS.  Central line placement was confirmed.

        Chief Complaint: LLQ Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Placement  History of Present Illness: HPI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 13712**] is a 58 year old female with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, diabetes mellitus 2 who presents to the ED today with LLQ abdominal pain x 1 day. On the evening prior to admission she developed nausea and vomiting.  According to ED notes, she denied fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  She presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . On presentation to the ED, the patient's vital signs were T 98.6, BP 189/92, HR 109, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA.  She appeared well initially however she developed rigors with temperature to 104.5, HR 156, BP 180/110.  During the episode she became more sedated but still responding to commands.  She was given tylenol, vancomycin 1g x1 and unasyn 3g IV x1.  Hemodynamics improved with these interventions however she had a second episode shortly thereafter.  Again she became tachycardic (HR 155), hypertensive (198/101) and T 105.  She was intubated for airway protection.  Labs were notable for WBC count elevated to 17.2, 2% bands, then subsequently was low at 3.7 with 16% bands.  Lactate on admission was 6.1, improved to 3.3 after hydration. UA was positive.  LFTs within normal limits.  CT abdomen showed L>R perinephric fat stranding and wedge shaped density c/w pyelo.  She was given 6L IVF.  CXR done post intubation showed vascular engorgement and low lying endotracheal tube.  Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] BPs noted to be systolic 80s, a right subclavian was placed.  She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment of urosepsis. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated and sedated. Her BP was systolic 80s, HR 120s on arrival.  Levophed was started.  She was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and given 1L NS.  Central line placement was confirmed.  No further history is able to be obtained.   Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus, type 2, last A1c 12.8% in [**Month (only) 547**]. Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia GERD

        Chief Complaint: LLQ Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Placement  History of Present Illness: HPI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 13712**] is a 58 year old female with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, diabetes mellitus 2 who presents to the ED today with LLQ abdominal pain x 1 day. On the evening prior to admission she developed nausea and vomiting.  According to ED notes, she denied fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  She presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . On presentation to the ED, the patient's vital signs were T 98.6, BP 189/92, HR 109, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA.  She appeared well initially however she developed rigors with temperature to 104.5, HR 156, BP 180/110.  During the episode she became more sedated but still responding to commands.  She was given tylenol, vancomycin 1g x1 and unasyn 3g IV x1.  Hemodynamics improved with these interventions however she had a second episode shortly thereafter.  Again she became tachycardic (HR 155), hypertensive (198/101) and T 105.  She was intubated for airway protection.  Labs were notable for WBC count elevated to 17.2, 2% bands, then subsequently was low at 3.7 with 16% bands.  Lactate on admission was 6.1, improved to 3.3 after hydration. UA was positive.  LFTs within normal limits.  CT abdomen showed L>R perinephric fat stranding and wedge shaped density c/w pyelo.  She was given 6L IVF.  CXR done post intubation showed vascular engorgement and low lying endotracheal tube.  Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] BPs noted to be systolic 80s, a right subclavian was placed.  She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment of urosepsis. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated and sedated. Her BP was systolic 80s, HR 120s on arrival.  Levophed was started.  She was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and given 1L NS.  Central line placement was confirmed.  No further history is able to be obtained.   Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus, type 2, last A1c 12.8% in [**Month (only) 547**]. Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia GERD

        Chief Complaint: LLQ Abdominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Placement  History of Present Illness: HPI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 13712**] is a 58 year old female with history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD, diabetes mellitus 2 who presents to the ED today with LLQ abdominal pain x 1 day. On the evening prior to admission she developed nausea and vomiting.  According to ED notes, she denied fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  She presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. . On presentation to the ED, the patient's vital signs were T 98.6, BP 189/92, HR 109, RR 20, O2sat 97% on RA.  She appeared well initially however she developed rigors with temperature to 104.5, HR 156, BP 180/110.  During the episode she became more sedated but still responding to commands.  She was given tylenol, vancomycin 1g x1 and unasyn 3g IV x1.  Hemodynamics improved with these interventions however she had a second episode shortly thereafter.  Again she became tachycardic (HR 155), hypertensive (198/101) and T 105.  She was intubated for airway protection.  Labs were notable for WBC count elevated to 17.2, 2% bands, then subsequently was low at 3.7 with 16% bands.  Lactate on admission was 6.1, improved to 3.3 after hydration. UA was positive.  LFTs within normal limits.  CT abdomen showed L>R perinephric fat stranding and wedge shaped density c/w pyelo.  She was given 6L IVF.  CXR done post intubation showed vascular engorgement and low lying endotracheal tube.  Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] BPs noted to be systolic 80s, a right subclavian was placed.  She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment of urosepsis. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated and sedated. Her BP was systolic 80s, HR 120s on arrival.  Levophed was started.  She was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and given 1L NS.  Central line placement was confirmed.  No further history is able to be obtained.   Past Medical History: Diabetes mellitus, type 2, last A1c 12.8% in [**Month (only) 547**]. Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia GERD

She appeared well initially however she developed rigors with temperature to 104.5, HR 156, BP 180/110.  During the episode she became more sedated but still responding to commands.  She was given tylenol, vancomycin 1g x1 and unasyn 3g IV x1.  Hemodynamics improved with these interventions however she had a second episode shortly thereafter.  Again she became tachycardic (HR 155), hypertensive (198/101) and T 105.  She was intubated for airway protection.  Labs were notable for WBC count elevated to 17.2, 2% bands, then subsequently was low at 3.7 with 16% bands.  Lactate on admission was 6.1, improved to 3.3 after hydration. UA was positive.  LFTs within normal limits.  CT abdomen showed L>R perinephric fat stranding and wedge shaped density c/w pyelo.  She was given 6L IVF.  CXR done post intubation showed vascular engorgement and low lying endotracheal tube.  Prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] BPs noted to be systolic 80s, a right subclavian was placed.  She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and treatment of urosepsis. . On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient is intubated and sedated. Her BP was systolic 80s, HR 120s on arrival.  Levophed was started.  She was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and given 1L NS.  Central line placement was confirmed.

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, hypoxia.  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube placement ([**4-22**]) Central venous line placement to right subclavian vein ([**4-22**]) Arterial line placement to right brachial artery ([**4-22**]) Intubation  History of Present Illness: This is a 74 year old man with a medical history of COPD, A-fib and lung CA who presents from OSH with increasing hypoxia three weeks after a right pneumonectomy. Patient started having cough and shortness of breath while at rehab aproximately three to four days prior to admission.  Initially it was with exertion then progressed to being at rest.  He noted subjective fevers and chills.  He had a cough which became worse and occasionally had some blood tinged sputum.  He had an incresing oxygen requirement and started to desat on a Non-reBreather (NRB). On [**4-19**] a chest XR was concerning for a Left Lower Lobe pneumonia and he was started on emperic Vamcomycin and Meropenum. He was evaluated at [**Hospital1 882**] ED and found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia. He was given Zosyn. He was going to be admitted to an ICU as he required a NRB, however there were no beds available. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] ED for further care. Of note, at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab he had a sputum culture which had sparse MRSA growth.  At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab he had LENI without DVT ([**4-20**]); CXR with LLL suspicious for PNA ([**4-19**]); TTE with normal EF (65%), septal dysrythmia, mild - mod pulm HTN  In ED, vitals were afebrile, HR: 120, BP: 107/69, RR: 25-30, O2 Sat:90-92%% on NRB and 84% when on Nebs. Patient recieved vamcomycin at 11am today and Zosyn at [**Hospital1 882**] ED at 5:30pm. His last dose of Meropenum was 1 day PTA. At the [**Hospital1 **] ED he recieved Albuterol and Ipratroprium nebs x3 and Salumedrol 125mg x1.

        Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND. She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension.

        Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND. She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61. She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She is being admitted to the CCU for further care. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  Past Medical History: PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1.

        Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND. She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61. She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She is being admitted to the CCU for further care. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  Past Medical History: PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1.

        Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND. She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61. She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She is being admitted to the CCU for further care. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  Past Medical History: PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1.

        Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND. She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. . In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from 124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61. She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She is being admitted to the CCU for further care. . On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.  Past Medical History: PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: 1. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: EF 75% 2. Atrial Fibrillation on Coumadin 3. Severe pulmonary hypertension . OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 4. Type 2 DM: complicated by diabetic retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy 5. Hyperlipidemia 6. Chronic Lymphedema with multiple lower extremity ulcers 7. Goiter: prior Radioiodine therapy, followed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80040**] 8. GERD 9. Crohn's Disease 10. Cholelithiasis - seen on U/S in past, no previous sx. 11. Achalasia 12. Sleep Apnea: h/o abnormal overnight pulse oximetry, but large thryoid goiter obstructs depending upon patient position . PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. TAH-BSO 2. Tonsillectomy 3.

Via an interpreter, the patient and his family recount that one day prior to admission, the patient was feeling ""weak"" with ""numbness"" in his feet and hands. He had little appetite and did not eat or drink much. Early on the day of admission, the patient was walking to the bathroom with the aid of his walker and felt weak and was unable to support himself so he ""slid"" to the floor. He denies loss of consciousness or injury to his head. He called for his wife, but he does not remember any events after this until he was in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. His wife reports that when she found her husband on the floor, he was awake and alert, but she was unable to lift him, so she called her son, who came over. He was concerned as he stated that his father did not look ""all there"" even though he was awake, so he called the ambulance. At the OSH, the patient was hypoglycemic with a FSG of 40 that resolved with D50. Cardiac enzymes were drawn, demonstrating a troponin of 9.08 with an unconcerning EKG. He received ASA and Plavix before being transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]. In the emergency room at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient denied chest pain, but was tachypneic to 25-30 and appeared diaphoretic and felt warm. Initial vitals were:T 100.6 HR 85, BP 148/61, RR 25, O2 Sat 100% on 4L. In addition to the ASA & Plavix, he was then placed on a heparin gtt and given Tylenol for his fever. .

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].   Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.  She also has a chronic productive cough.  She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.  Last hospitalization was in [**2193-2-26**].

        Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS X2 to RCA  central venous line placements IR guided exchange of HD catheter over wire IR guided arterial line placement Skin biopsy Bone marrow biopsy Kidney biopsy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 44 yo F with h/o asthma who presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] ER with dyspnea, found to have possible pneumonia and asthma exacerbation, was intubated and found to have NSTEMI.  Pt is currently intubated and sedated.  Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.  Her niece had called 911 and the patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ER.  VS were: 124/71, pulse 107, RR 30, O2 sat 84% on RA.  On exam, she was noted to be diaphoretic and have expiratory wheezing.  CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.  Pt was started on Bipap and admitted to the ICU.  She failed Bipap and was then intubated.  Pt was treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and solumedrol.  Tmax was 100.4.  Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.  She was treated with IV Lasix, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and plavix and transferred here.  . In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg. . Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.  Per sister, she had normal stress tests, perhaps a year ago.

The patient denied any associated fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion or headaches. On [**2166-12-16**], the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This study revealed moderate diffuse abdominal and pelvic ascites. In addition, the omentum was noted to be thickened and somewhat nodular.  There was an asymmetric fullness of the left adnexa.  The patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation.  On [**2166-12-17**], the patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis. 1.5 liters of cloudy, yellow fluid was removed and sent for the appropriate studies.  Serum CA 125 level was found to be elevated at 746. CEA is 1.8.  Cytology from the peritoneal fluid is pending.  On [**2166-12-19**], the patient underwent a second paracentesis.

The patient denied any associated fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion or headaches. On [**2166-12-16**], the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This study revealed moderate diffuse abdominal and pelvic ascites. In addition, the omentum was noted to be thickened and somewhat nodular.  There was an asymmetric fullness of the left adnexa.  The patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation.  On [**2166-12-17**], the patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis. 1.5 liters of cloudy, yellow fluid was removed and sent for the appropriate studies.  Serum CA 125 level was found to be elevated at 746. CEA is 1.8.  Cytology from the peritoneal fluid is pending.  On [**2166-12-19**], the patient underwent a second paracentesis.

        Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

        Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

        Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

        Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

        HPI:
        Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s/p allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123/85 CMV/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD

        Chief Complaint: Altered mental status.  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation.   History of Present Illness: This is a 45-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of tonic-clonic seizures (in context of history of head injury and skull fracture 25 years ago) on Lamotrigine, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, and anxiety who is transferred from the MICU to the general medicine floor after an acute change in mental status at work and gait instability. . Patient states he has experienced progressive fatigue for the past 6 months.  He developed a headache and ""sinus congestion"" 2 days ago, and began taking OTC medication (sudafed) for nasal stuffiness.  Patient has also been taking herbal supplement (one of which contains lithium) for the past 2 months, which he buys on the internet; patient states that his doctor will no longer refill his prescriptions, as he hasn't been in to see her for a long time. . Patient drove to work on day of admission without any trouble. However, when he got to his office he was found to be increasingly confused and with slurred speech.  He was told to ""go home"" by his boss, but his behavior became increasingly more bizzare (couldn't lift bottle of water to his lips, weak, confused, unbalanced, etc). and EMS was called. . On arrival to the ED, VS were: T97.3, HR 110->95, BP 140/110, RR 16, O2 Sat 100% on 100% NRB.  Patient was found to be somnolent in the ED and neurology was consulted.  Thought that episode was likely due to intoxication from multiple medications, including lithium (in one of the herbal supplements he was taking).  His tox screen was positive for: tricyclics, amphetamine (sudafed), and methadone (possibly from Ultram).  Patient was given ceftriaxone and vanc for presumed meningitis.  An LP was done, which was not consistent with bacterial infection however, patient was continued on acyclovir.  Mr. [**Known lastname 55334**] was intubated for a GCS of [**5-23**] (withdrawal to pain). and transferred to the MICU.  He did well overnight and was extubated the following morning.  His lithium level is coming down, and he is being followed by neurology and toxicology.  Vitals on transfer: BP: 124/78, HR: 100, RR: 16, SP02: 99% on RA. . ROS:  As per HPI.  Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain with urination, current fevers or chills.  Past Medical History: - Generalized seizure disorder on lamictal, no recent dose changes.  Patient states that last seizure was a few days prior to arrival and wittnesed by wife.  Normally post-ictal. - Migraines that are temporally related to seizures and started recently after seizure disorder diagnosis made - Anxiety (?) - takes clonazepam prn - HTN - HL - Gout - History of MVA with skull fracture while in his 20s.

Per wife, he was at his USOH until [**10-21**] night, but had temps to 102. Next am, was fine until afternoon, developed rigors.  Has been having gas/intermittent diarrhea on/off for weeks. No abdominal pain/vomiting.  On arrival to OSH his temp was 103 and he was initially normotensive. No leukocytosis, creat 2.4, LFTs wnl, lipase okay, flu negative. Had episode of NBNB emesis. Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.  Got flagyl and levo at OSH, 1L IVfs. En Route to [**Hospital1 18**], reported hypotension/brady, thus on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], got 2L IVFs, BP better since. .

        Chief Complaint: fever, chills, transferred from outside hospital for ERCP to evaluate pneumobilia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography  History of Present Illness: HPI on transfer to Gen Med floor on [**10-24**] Patient is a 78 year old male with a h/o htn, dementia and hypercholesterolemia who presented to [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**10-22**] with two days of fever and diarrhea. Per wife, he was at his USOH until [**10-21**] night, but had temps to 102. Next am, was fine until afternoon, developed rigors.  Has been having gas/intermittent diarrhea on/off for weeks. No abdominal pain/vomiting.  On arrival to OSH his temp was 103 and he was initially normotensive. No leukocytosis, creat 2.4, LFTs wnl, lipase okay, flu negative. Had episode of NBNB emesis. Underwent CT scan of his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.  Got flagyl and levo at OSH, 1L IVfs. En Route to [**Hospital1 18**], reported hypotension/brady, thus on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], got 2L IVFs, BP better since. . Since his transfer blood cultures from the outside hospital became positive with 4/4 bottles growing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report. He has been on Unasyn, he was also found to have [**1-21**] blood cx positive from the ER for Gram+ cocci in clusters, Vanc started (stopped [**10-24**] since CONS). He has been evaluated by surgery and ERCP service [**10-22**]. Had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed concern for possible air vs. stone in the gall bladder, and possible air in the left lobe of the liver. These findings were most concerning for biliary enteric fistula vs. emphysematous cholecystitis, with emphysematous cholecystitis being less likely base on imaging. Was still having fevers on [**10-23**]. Cipro was added for double coverage.  After ERCP consult, it was recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].  Underwent ERCP on [**10-24**] with sphincterotomy, stone fragment extraction, no pus, no fistula. last temp was 103 on am of [**10-24**] (0500) a/w rigors (before ERCP).  . [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for acute hypoxia, resp distress on [**10-24**] am. Got lasix and nebs with some improvement. IVF stopped. Echo with mod-severe MR, nl EF. . Was transfered to Gen Med evening [**10-24**] after ERCP. He currently has no complaints, saying that he feels well.  Is npo given ERCP.  his diarrhea is improving.

        Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right great toe amputation  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and hypotension.  The patient reports ""a couple"" of days of feeling generally unwell with malaise and a fever.  He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.  He also endosres some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea. No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He was sent to the ED after his daughter noted him rigoring at rehab and demanded he be sent to the hospital.  In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132/80 R 26 O2 sat 99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.  As the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted regarding management.  The patient was given levofloxacin, acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.  He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.  Overnight the patient was weaned off norepinephrine.  He also defervesced and has been afebrile today.  He received one unit Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.  ID consulted and are recommending daptomycin (patient was on course as an outpatient) and pipercillin-tazobactam as well as discontinuing PICC and scan to r/o abscess.  Plan was for podiatry to amputate toe in AM but patient's daughter and HCP requested vascular to perform this operation so timing is currently unclear.

        Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right great toe amputation  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and hypotension.  The patient reports ""a couple"" of days of feeling generally unwell with malaise and a fever.  He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.  He also endosres some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea. No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He was sent to the ED after his daughter noted him rigoring at rehab and demanded he be sent to the hospital.  In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132/80 R 26 O2 sat 99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.  As the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted regarding management.  The patient was given levofloxacin, acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.  He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.  Overnight the patient was weaned off norepinephrine.  He also defervesced and has been afebrile today.  He received one unit Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.  ID consulted and are recommending daptomycin (patient was on course as an outpatient) and pipercillin-tazobactam as well as discontinuing PICC and scan to r/o abscess.  Plan was for podiatry to amputate toe in AM but patient's daughter and HCP requested vascular to perform this operation so timing is currently unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] report blood cultures from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab are growing gram positive cultures in pairs and clusters as well as gram negative rods.  Currently, he reports feeling fatigued but denies specific complaints.

He feels this was related to an atenolol allergy. In the ED, his vitals were T 100.8, BP 135/72, HR 45, and 94% on RA. He was given lasix 20 mg and aspirin in the ED. He additionally complained of chest pain, dyspnea and diaphoresis though he was unreliable in the ED. Per there report, he was responsive to sternal rub and answered limited questions for them. He reports that he was given a prescription for atenolol at [**Hospital1 2177**] but has a history of atenolol allergy. . In the ED, VS: 100.8 135/72 45 16 94%RA.

        Chief Complaint: acute alcoholic hepatitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: paracentesis  History of Present Illness: This is a 53 year old female with a hx of alcoholism and binge drinking since her teenage years who presents with liver failure. She initially presented to [**Hospital1 34**] from [**10-31**] to [**11-4**] with jaundice, and found to have a Bili of 30 and an INR of 2.3. During that admission she also developed mild ARF, Cr. to 1.4, but it improved to 1.1 at the time of discharge. She was also noted to have a leukocytosis of 16.7 but only small ascites on ultrasound, not tapped. She was evaluated for other forms of liver disease which was negative, including negative hepatitis viral serologies, negative [**Doctor First Name **], and a ceruloplasmin of 29. It was thought to be alcoholic hepatitis and she was started on 40mg PO steroids starting [**11-1**]. She was seen in follow up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31823**], GI, and she was feeling ""miserable"" with decreased PO intake. On labs drawn then, her bili had worsened to 41 and her creatinine was 2.2 with a BUN of 47. She also had a worsened WBC count to 29K. She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 34**], given IVF with no improvement in her renal function and poor UOP. She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. She underwent an abdominal ultrasound prior to transfer with marking for paracentesis but did not get a paracentesis. . The patient states that her last drink was 4 weeks ago. On admission she had c/o mild abdominal discomfort and fullness. She has also experienced dypnea on exertion while moving to the bathroom.  Patient had emotional breakdown on the floor.  She wanted to go home.  She was found to be sinus tachycardia to 110s.  Her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% in RA from 92-93% and came upto 92% on 3LNC.  Liver team wanted her to be monitored closely and requested ICU transfer. . On arrival to the MICU her vitals were T 99.4  Hr 110  BP 101/53  RR 24  92% 3LNC.  She states that she feels calmer.  Deneis any chest pain, shorntess of breath, palpitations, HA, visual changes, cough, diarrhea, constipations, f/c, rash, focal weakness or numbness.  No other complaints.

She initially presented to [**Hospital1 34**] from [**10-31**] to [**11-4**] with jaundice, and found to have a Bili of 30 and an INR of 2.3. During that admission she also developed mild ARF, Cr. to 1.4, but it improved to 1.1 at the time of discharge. She was also noted to have a leukocytosis of 16.7 but only small ascites on ultrasound, not tapped. She was evaluated for other forms of liver disease which was negative, including negative hepatitis viral serologies, negative [**Doctor First Name **], and a ceruloplasmin of 29. It was thought to be alcoholic hepatitis and she was started on 40mg PO steroids starting [**11-1**]. She was seen in follow up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31823**], GI, and she was feeling ""miserable"" with decreased PO intake. On labs drawn then, her bili had worsened to 41 and her creatinine was 2.2 with a BUN of 47. She also had a worsened WBC count to 29K. She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 34**], given IVF with no improvement in her renal function and poor UOP. She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. She underwent an abdominal ultrasound prior to transfer with marking for paracentesis but did not get a paracentesis. . The patient states that her last drink was 4 weeks ago. On admission she had c/o mild abdominal discomfort and fullness. She has also experienced dypnea on exertion while moving to the bathroom.  Patient had emotional breakdown on the floor.  She wanted to go home.  She was found to be sinus tachycardia to 110s.  Her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% in RA from 92-93% and came upto 92% on 3LNC.  Liver team wanted her to be monitored closely and requested ICU transfer. . On arrival to the MICU her vitals were T 99.4  Hr 110  BP 101/53  RR 24  92% 3LNC.  She states that she feels calmer.  Deneis any chest pain, shorntess of breath, palpitations, HA, visual changes, cough, diarrhea, constipations, f/c, rash, focal weakness or numbness.  No other complaints.

        Chief Complaint: gastrocutaneous fistula  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p gastrocuataneous fistula takedown, small bowel resection, and g-tube placment   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] is an unfortunate 32-year-old woman with severe mental retardation due to Rett syndrome. In the remote past she had undergone a Nissen fundoplication with placement of an open gastrostomy tube. She was completely dependent on tube feeding.  She had progressively witnessed widening of her gastrostomy tract until it had become an open fistula with marked breakdown of the surrounding skin. Over the previous 2 months, multiple attempts had been made by the interventional radiology and gastroenterology services to close the opening with noninvasive means including Gelfoam packing. None of these had been successful.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] was to have seen the patient electively to consider surgery, but she instead, entered the hospital via the emergency room with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, with a 10-point decrease her hematocrit requiring transfusion. The effluent through the open gastrostomy was consistent with coffee grounds. She never had bright red blood. She arrived at our hospital on intravenous vancomycin and Zosyn treating an unclear source of presumed infection. She was stated to have a pneumonia, but had a normal chest x-ray and ultimately a normal chest CT scan. We had continued the antibiotics. She had mild elevations of her lipase and amylase which had no correlate on her CT scan. Her gallbladder appeared to be normal, as was the pancreas. In addition, upon arrival she was profoundly dehydrated with a creatinine of 1.9, with a baseline of 0.3. She had been placed on intravenous nutrition 2 months earlier when use of the G-tube was thought to be unwise.

        Chief Complaint: hematemasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None at [**Hospital1 18**] (EGD at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a  44 year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, Type I diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism, who presents with hematemesis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3924**] was in his usual state of fair-good health until the morning of [**5-8**], when he describes new fatigue and sweating (with heat intolerance) on awakening.  10-20 minutes later, he reports rapid-onset epigastric abdominal pain (5/10 intensity, sharp quality, non-radiating), with 2 episodes of vomiting large 5-10cm blood clots.  At this point, the patient reports feeling mentally ""foggy,"" with moderate dizziness and mild shortness of breath.  EMS was called, and the patient was brought by ambulance to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital ([**Hospital1 189**]).  The patient reports two episodes of nosebleed over the past week (compared to no bleeding at baseline).  He reports his last drink ([**2-20**] shots whisky) was on the night prior to the present episode.  He denies loss of conciousness, tremor, itchiness, hematochezia, melena, changes in vision or hearing, previous episodes of hematemesis, recent abdominal pain, or recent history of vomiting. . At the OSH, the patient vomited copious amounts of bright red blood (""filling [**3-21**] vomit bags"").  SBP was down to 80-90s, with HCT 33 and glucose 450.  Stool was guaiac + .  He received fluids, 2 units packed RBCs, protonix IV q12, ciprofloxacin, octrotide, vit K, and humalog (10 units x2).  An EGD revealed esophageal varices (grade 4).  Variceal banding was performed, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-9**] for further management. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the patient had T 36.4 P 72 BP 83-103/62 RR 16 SaO2 94 % (RA), with one initial episode of nausea and small coffee-ground emesis.  Hct was 32.4 on admission (low of 25.8). He was observed for --- hours, found to be hemodynamically stable, and transferred to the floor. . On the floor, the patient reports good appetite, with no residual nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, or fatigue.  Hct was up from 25.8 to 28.  He denies further vomiting episodes. . . ROS: The patient reports a new-onset sore throat on [**5-7**] (two days prior to presentation), with swollen glands.  He denies new onset nausea/vomiting.  The patient experienced a motorcycle accident 3 weeks prior to admission (cycle drove through garage door).  He reports trauma to his nasal cartilage, but denies known abdominal or chest trauma.  He reports a recent weight gain of 6 pounds (from 166-172) over the past 3 weeks.  The patient reports a mild cough over the past 4-5 months (denies hemoptysis).  Over the past 1-2 weeks, the patient notes small undigested pieces of vegetables (e.g. carrots) in his stool (which he attributes to a new-onset difficulty of digestion). Review of systems was otherwise negative except as specified in the HPI (specifically, the patient denies change in PO intake of foods/ fluids, new joint pains, dysuria, hematuria, new rashes/bumps, diarrhea/constipation).

        Chief Complaint: hematemasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None at [**Hospital1 18**] (EGD at [**Hospital3 20284**] Center)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a  44 year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, Type I diabetes, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism, who presents with hematemesis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3924**] was in his usual state of fair-good health until the morning of [**5-8**], when he describes new fatigue and sweating (with heat intolerance) on awakening.  10-20 minutes later, he reports rapid-onset epigastric abdominal pain (5/10 intensity, sharp quality, non-radiating), with 2 episodes of vomiting large 5-10cm blood clots.  At this point, the patient reports feeling mentally ""foggy,"" with moderate dizziness and mild shortness of breath.  EMS was called, and the patient was brought by ambulance to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital ([**Hospital1 189**]).  The patient reports two episodes of nosebleed over the past week (compared to no bleeding at baseline).  He reports his last drink ([**2-20**] shots whisky) was on the night prior to the present episode.  He denies loss of conciousness, tremor, itchiness, hematochezia, melena, changes in vision or hearing, previous episodes of hematemesis, recent abdominal pain, or recent history of vomiting. . At the OSH, the patient vomited copious amounts of bright red blood (""filling [**3-21**] vomit bags"").  SBP was down to 80-90s, with HCT 33 and glucose 450.  Stool was guaiac + .  He received fluids, 2 units packed RBCs, protonix IV q12, ciprofloxacin, octrotide, vit K, and humalog (10 units x2).  An EGD revealed esophageal varices (grade 4).  Variceal banding was performed, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-9**] for further management. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the patient had T 36.4 P 72 BP 83-103/62 RR 16 SaO2 94 % (RA), with one initial episode of nausea and small coffee-ground emesis.  Hct was 32.4 on admission (low of 25.8). He was observed for --- hours, found to be hemodynamically stable, and transferred to the floor. . On the floor, the patient reports good appetite, with no residual nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, or fatigue.  Hct was up from 25.8 to 28.  He denies further vomiting episodes. . . ROS: The patient reports a new-onset sore throat on [**5-7**] (two days prior to presentation), with swollen glands.  He denies new onset nausea/vomiting.  The patient experienced a motorcycle accident 3 weeks prior to admission (cycle drove through garage door).  He reports trauma to his nasal cartilage, but denies known abdominal or chest trauma.  He reports a recent weight gain of 6 pounds (from 166-172) over the past 3 weeks.  The patient reports a mild cough over the past 4-5 months (denies hemoptysis).  Over the past 1-2 weeks, the patient notes small undigested pieces of vegetables (e.g. carrots) in his stool (which he attributes to a new-onset difficulty of digestion). Review of systems was otherwise negative except as specified in the HPI (specifically, the patient denies change in PO intake of foods/ fluids, new joint pains, dysuria, hematuria, new rashes/bumps, diarrhea/constipation).   Past Medical History: 1. Hemochromatosis (diagnosed [**2122**].

He reports his last drink ([**2-20**] shots whisky) was on the night prior to the present episode.  He denies loss of conciousness, tremor, itchiness, hematochezia, melena, changes in vision or hearing, previous episodes of hematemesis, recent abdominal pain, or recent history of vomiting. . At the OSH, the patient vomited copious amounts of bright red blood (""filling [**3-21**] vomit bags"").  SBP was down to 80-90s, with HCT 33 and glucose 450.  Stool was guaiac + .  He received fluids, 2 units packed RBCs, protonix IV q12, ciprofloxacin, octrotide, vit K, and humalog (10 units x2).  An EGD revealed esophageal varices (grade 4).  Variceal banding was performed, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**5-9**] for further management. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, the patient had T 36.4 P 72 BP 83-103/62 RR 16 SaO2 94 % (RA), with one initial episode of nausea and small coffee-ground emesis.  Hct was 32.4 on admission (low of 25.8). He was observed for --- hours, found to be hemodynamically stable, and transferred to the floor. .

In [**2-/2138**], a CT scan showed the mass was enlarging and causing biliary obstruction.  He had a negative octreotide scan at that time.  However, on [**2138-3-19**] an AFP was over 3000.  On [**2138-3-28**] he had an exploratory laparotomy and nodule biopsy along with intraoperative ultrasound which suggested that the carcinoma was unresectable.

His liver function tests were abnormal. Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a 7.3 x 6.4 x 9 cm mass in the right lobe of the liver, extending in to the left lobe.  [**1-/2138**], a biopsy was performed, which revealed a neuroendocrine carcinoma positive for CK7 and 20, chromogranins and synaptophysin and S-100.  In [**2-/2138**], a CT scan showed the mass was enlarging and causing biliary obstruction.  He had a negative octreotide scan at that time.  However, on [**2138-3-19**] an AFP was over 3000.  On [**2138-3-28**] he had an exploratory laparotomy and nodule biopsy along with intraoperative ultrasound which suggested that the carcinoma was unresectable. Since that time he has had seven cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin as well as sorafenib who has continued to have disease progression on those therapies.  .

Poor historian with reported poor follow up history in chart and unclear about what meds he takes at home. Tried suppositories and laxatives without effect initially but then states that he had small BM yesterday at home. Last colonoscopy was over 10 yrs ago per pt. Arrived in ED because he states Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5717**] was not in office - he mainly arrives with c/o urinary retention. Of note, it appears that he was on flomax in past and has been referred to urology for w/u with elevated PSA around 6, but he states he is no longer taking this med. He also failed to f/u with urology for prostate bx. Denies abd pain, n/v, or any other sx. In ED, vitals were 98.8, 57, 124/61, 16, 97% RA. KUB consistant with constipation, no stool in rectum. Foley was placed and urine relieved. Given enema with another small BM, pt states that now his bowels are relieved. Labs notable for Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.1), Na slightly elevated to 146 c/w dehydration. On transfer from ED to floor, pt was comfortable, without pain, and only concerned for urinary retention. During the course of his hospitalization, he experienced chest pain and shortness of breath. His pain was reported to radiate from to his throat and resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and oxygen administration. ECG demonstrated LBBB with ST depressions in II and AVF which resolved. CE Tn 0.02 -> 0.08 -> 0.14. CK 174 -> 178 -> 138. Cardiac cath deferred until INR decreased from 3.3. He was clopidogrel loaded with 300mg. Cardiac cath demonstrated severe 3 vessel CAD with single remaining vessel with 90% left main supplying LAD and collateralized RCA. PCI deferred for surgical evaluation. On arrival to the CCU the patient is resting comfortably. He currently denies shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, PND or orthopnea. He denies palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope. All other review of systems were negative. Cardiac cath done [**3-29**] with 3VD and referred for surgery.

Labs notable for Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.1), Na slightly elevated to 146 c/w dehydration. On transfer from ED to floor, pt was comfortable, without pain, and only concerned for urinary retention. During the course of his hospitalization, he experienced chest pain and shortness of breath.

Foley was placed and urine relieved. Given enema with another small BM, pt states that now his bowels are relieved. Labs notable for Cr 1.5 (baseline 1.1), Na slightly elevated to 146 c/w dehydration. On transfer from ED to floor, pt was comfortable, without pain, and only concerned for urinary retention. During the course of his hospitalization, he experienced chest pain and shortness of breath. His pain was reported to radiate from to his throat and resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and oxygen administration. ECG demonstrated LBBB with ST depressions in II and AVF which resolved. CE Tn 0.02 -> 0.08 -> 0.14. CK 174 -> 178 -> 138. Cardiac cath deferred until INR decreased from 3.3. He was clopidogrel loaded with 300mg.

On arrival to the CCU the patient is resting comfortably. He currently denies shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, PND or orthopnea. He denies palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope. All other review of systems were negative. Cardiac cath done [**3-29**] with 3VD and referred for surgery.

        Chief Complaint: Fevers, altered mental status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: - ERCP - Placement of PICC line  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a pleasant 83 year old female, followed by biliary service at [**Hospital1 18**] for biliary obstruction status-post stenting for likely malignancy, though not biopsy proven, as well as a history of cholangitis. She was at home with her husband, who noted on morning of admission she was much less responsive than usual, and that she felt warm to the touch. He describes that she was slightly more somnolent the day prior to admission. He was concerned and called EMS. She was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**]. There, she was noted to have a white blood cell count of 26 with bands, a total bilirubin of 2.4, no acute chest process on chest x-ray, and a mildly positive urine analysis with 1+ LE. She was given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl over concern of cholangitis. Her INR was over 8, and she was given 10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Blood and urine cultures were drawn prior to administration of antibiotics. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] abdominal ultrasound was completed, which demonstrated no change in known intrahepatic dilatation, two common bile duct stents in place, and no obvious abscesses. Her vitals at that time were: temperature of 101.4 rectal, stable blood pressure (never hypotensive, lowest 120/40) 160/70, RR 24, Sat 98% on NRB. She was noted to be rigoring and was somnolent but somewhat arousable. Her laboratories were notable for a transaminitis AST >ALT, lactate 2.4, INR 7.7. She received more vitamin K, was seen by surgery and was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for plan to ERCP in AM. . Of note, patient had recent admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for polymicrobial sepsis in setting of biliary stent obstruction due to tumor. She underwent ERCP with successful flushing of stents. Her course was complicated by afib with RVR, DVT and liver abscesses not amenable to drainage. . Blood cultures at that time grew:  enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin; E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins; Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp. . Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she would open her eyes to tactile stimuli and would squeeze her hand when ask; she was not otherwise interactive.   Past Medical History: Biliary obstruction/malignant stricture s/p ERCP X 2 and 2 metal stents--last placed in [**9-12**]. Thought to be cholangiocarcinoma, no clear pathologic diagnosis made. By report, evaluated by surgical team, thought not to be a surgical candidate.

[**Name2 (NI) **] denies shortness of breath with the episodes and has never experienced them previously.  He states that on the day prior to admission he developed a cough with white sputum and shortness of breath. He describes 3 pillow orthopnea and could not sleep because of his breathing.  He also had lightheadness which persisted which is why he came to the ED.  He denies sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] denies fevers, chills, night sweats.  He denies green or brown sputum production. . In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 HR 220 BP 142/117 RR 24 O2 97% RA. He was found to be in afib with RVR on arrival with stable blood pressures and otherwise asymptomatic.  He was given 20mg IV diltiazem and started on a dilt gtt at 5mg/hr.  He had a CXR which showed a ?RLL PNA which was difficult to visualize. He then began to be more tachypneic with RR in the 30s and oxygen sats dropped requiring a non-breather. Due to concerns for PE he underwent CTA which showed no PE.  It showed mild CHF and pulmonary nodules.  After the CT scan, he was more tachypneic with RR in the 40s and O2 sats 95% on NRB.

        Chief Complaint: A fib with RVR, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE ICU monitoring   History of Present Illness: 52 yo male with history of a fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of A fib with RVR in the setting of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive of clear to white sputum.  Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports he was able to walk approximately 100feet before becoming short of breath.  He does report at times he has felt lightheaded, however has never lost consciousness.  He reports this episode was very similar to when he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  He denies any orthopnea or PND.  He denies any chest pain or palpitations.  EMS gave the patient diltiazem en route to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER as his rate was in the 180's.   In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.  Cardiology was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.  After this treatment, the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 80's systolic. The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still in the ER.  He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and continued on a drip following.   On admission to the floor, the patient was continued on this regimen.  DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  At this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was discontinued.  The patient was also found to be febrile, have leukocytosis and productive cough.  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP, however this was discontinued prior to transfer.  On transfer, the patient's HR was in the 170's, but normotensive.  On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

        Chief Complaint: A fib with RVR, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: TEE ICU monitoring   History of Present Illness: 52 yo male with history of a fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for management of A fib with RVR in the setting of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive of clear to white sputum.  Over the past two days prior to admission he reported worsening fatigue and malaise as well as dyspnea on exertion.  The patient reports he was able to walk approximately 100feet before becoming short of breath.  He does report at times he has felt lightheaded, however has never lost consciousness.  He reports this episode was very similar to when he presented with a wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  He denies any orthopnea or PND.  He denies any chest pain or palpitations.  EMS gave the patient diltiazem en route to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ER as his rate was in the 180's.   In the ER at [**Hospital1 1474**], he received another 110mg of diltiazem and 15mg of IV lopressor.  Cardiology was consulted in the ER and recommended heparin drip, diltiazem drip, digoxin 0.25mg and lasix 40mg.  After this treatment, the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 80's systolic. The diltiazem drip was discontinued while the patient was still in the ER.  He was then given a bolus of amiodarone and continued on a drip following.   On admission to the floor, the patient was continued on this regimen.  DC cardioversion was discussed, however a TEE showed evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**].  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient has a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia in [**2107-1-7**].  At this time, all nodal agents were held and digoxin was discontinued.  The patient was also found to be febrile, have leukocytosis and productive cough.  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin temporarily for presumed CAP, however this was discontinued prior to transfer.  On transfer, the patient's HR was in the 170's, but normotensive.  On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous  thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Prior to presentation to the hospital he was unable to transfer from his bed without marked SOB. At [**Location (un) **], BNP was noted to be elevated and CXR showed increased interstitial markings. He was seen by Cardiology consult service who recommended rule out for MI, repeat echo, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. He was diuresed and for his AF initially started on a diltiazem gtt and then converted to Metoprolol 25mg q6H to treat his heart rate. At some point during the hospitalization he was started on amiodarone and cardioverted. He was reportedly hypotensive on [**3-5**] and therefore the consulting cardiologist requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. . He was also noted to be in acute renal failure with increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 2.1 attributed to treatment with lasix, ACE and beta blocker. He was treated with Duonebs for COPD. . On [**2185-2-4**] the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] for chest pain. He was found to be in 2nd degree heart block attributed to medications. His digoxin was stopped at that time. He required intubation transiently. He ruled out for MI. During that admission he was diuresed, treated with low dose beta blocker, ACE and diuretics and was started on amiodarone for HR control. . On arrival to the CCU the patient is comfortable. He is oxygenating well on 2L NC. He is in sinus rhythm. .   Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation on coumadin s/p CVA with minimal left sided weakness - [**2179-10-9**] Congestive heart failure, EF 40% CAD - negative nuclear study in [**2181**]. No history of MI. Last cath 4 years ago. COPD Peripheral vascular disease Peptic ulcer disease Dyslipidemia Anxiety Depression Hypertension Chronic pain syndrome

Subsequently on [**12-5**] he had a hypoxic event and a diagnosis of PE was made; which required intubation. Since that time he has required AC ventilation with requirements of FIO2 80%/PEEP 5. Of note, this hypoxic event was felt to be extensive and patients neurologic status has not improved since. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab on the ventilation while on heparin & today was transferred back to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] for evaluation for Trach/PEG.

        Chief Complaint: Blurry vision  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: insulin drip   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year old female with past medical history of sarcoidosis who presented with blurred vision. . Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily for her sarcoidosis about two weeks ago on [**2-9**]/3009, and has been tapered down to 20 mg. Over the last two weeks, she has experienced blurry vision. She also noted increased frequency of urination, thirst, and increased appetite as she was always hungry. She also noted white spots in her mouth and vaginal itching consistent with a yeast infection. . She presented this evening to the emergency room for further management of blurred vision, thrush, and left-sided chest discomfort. Her initial vital signs were: pain of [**7-13**], temperature of 97.4, heart rate of 76, blood pressure 136/95, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. A finger stick was checked and discovered to be critically high. She was given two liters of intravenous fluids and a 10 unit bolus of insulin, however a finger stick remained critically high, so she was started on an insulin drip which was reported to be at 7 units per hour at time of transfer with a finger stick still critically high. Her examination in the ED was notable for thrush, as well as visual acuity of 20/70 on the right, 20/50 on the left, and 20/70 both eyes. A chest x-ray was unremarkable. She was given a total of 4 liters of IVF prior to transfer. . Upon transfer to the ICU, she reports she feels better. She denies any pain or complaints at present aside from some left sided breast/axilla pain. . In the ICU she was on an insulin gtt then transitioned to SQ insulin lantus and SSI. She failed 2x requiring re-initation of insulin gtt until today with [**Last Name (un) **] recommendation. BS 260-300 on current regimen. This was complicated by dietary indescretion and difficulty coping with a new diagnosis.

        Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture ([**2139-1-22**])   History of Present Illness: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72M left handed psychiatrist with h/o ESRD s/p ECD renal transplant [**2131**] complicated by bx-proved BK nepropathy treated with cidofovir now with failing graft (Cr 3.5), diffuse large B cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (1) 95198**]) and 2xIT MTX and 2xIT ARA-C with bone mets, CAD and CABG x3 [**2130**], CHF with EF 30% and 2+ MR, DM, depression, and laryngeal ca who presents from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of altered mental status.   As recently as [**2138-11-9**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seeing pts as a psychiatrist after finishing five months of chemotherapy for lymphoma. His wife notes some paraphasic errors in his speech and difficulties with abstraction over the past year, but not major cognitive deficits. He was able to walk with a cane, but had progressively worsening gait from neuropathy secondary to diabetes and vincristine. In late [**Month (only) **], he fell four times in one week and felt significantly weaker so his PCP advised him to seek medical attention. He was hospitalized [**Date range (2) 95199**]. Recurrent falls thought to be multifactorial with a degree of spinal stenosis and neuropathy.  He was readmitted [**Date range (1) 95200**] from rehab for AMS. Admission BUN 103 and Cr 4.4. Found to improve when sedating medications (lorazepam, oxycodone, modafinil, buproprion, gabapentin) removed and with HD. No infectious etiology identified. D/C'ed to [**Hospital1 **].  Over the next two weeks, pt's wife continued to be concerned about his mental status. Per wife, he was disoriented and talking about ""running marathons."" Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by his oncologist on [**2139-1-6**], who also noted disorientation. Thought possibly due to uremia, but no improvement with HD, so oncologist did LP. CSF with 8 WBC, 3 RBC, Protein unavailable, Glucose 105, HHV negative, culture negative, and ""clonality not assessed due to insufficient B cells.:  Dr. [**Known lastname **] continued to stay at [**Hospital1 **]. He improved slightly, at one point able to get OOB and walk 100ft with walker and PT. After this improvement, however, his mental status became progressively worse. Wife describes pt as disoriented to time and place. He once asked for peanuts when he was already holding some in his hands. Over the last several days, these confusional states have gone from intermittent (worse in early AM and then PM) to continuous. Per wife, today's hospitalization results from cumulative decline and was not precipitated by an acute event. Wife does not recall any recent medication changes or acute illnesses other than above.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Neurological: Denies HA, neck pain, visual change, difficulties in hearing, talking, swallowing. Wife notes some paraphasic errors and difficulty with abstract thought. Also pt seems to have difficulties with balance and weakness in R side. Pt also has remote hx of head trauma [**2-10**] MVC as child, possibly involving damage to ? temporal lobe, and had some seizures as a child. Some increased urinary urge and frequency but without incontinence and baseline per wife. [**Name (NI) **] other changes in bowel/bladder habits.

        Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar puncture ([**2139-1-22**])   History of Present Illness: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72M left handed psychiatrist with h/o ESRD s/p ECD renal transplant [**2131**] complicated by bx-proved BK nepropathy treated with cidofovir now with failing graft (Cr 3.5), diffuse large B cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-[**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (1) 95198**]) and 2xIT MTX and 2xIT ARA-C with bone mets, CAD and CABG x3 [**2130**], CHF with EF 30% and 2+ MR, DM, depression, and laryngeal ca who presents from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of altered mental status.   As recently as [**2138-11-9**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seeing pts as a psychiatrist after finishing five months of chemotherapy for lymphoma. His wife notes some paraphasic errors in his speech and difficulties with abstraction over the past year, but not major cognitive deficits. He was able to walk with a cane, but had progressively worsening gait from neuropathy secondary to diabetes and vincristine. In late [**Month (only) **], he fell four times in one week and felt significantly weaker so his PCP advised him to seek medical attention. He was hospitalized [**Date range (2) 95199**]. Recurrent falls thought to be multifactorial with a degree of spinal stenosis and neuropathy.  He was readmitted [**Date range (1) 95200**] from rehab for AMS. Admission BUN 103 and Cr 4.4. Found to improve when sedating medications (lorazepam, oxycodone, modafinil, buproprion, gabapentin) removed and with HD. No infectious etiology identified. D/C'ed to [**Hospital1 **].  Over the next two weeks, pt's wife continued to be concerned about his mental status. Per wife, he was disoriented and talking about ""running marathons."" Dr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by his oncologist on [**2139-1-6**], who also noted disorientation. Thought possibly due to uremia, but no improvement with HD, so oncologist did LP.

He improved slightly, at one point able to get OOB and walk 100ft with walker and PT. After this improvement, however, his mental status became progressively worse. Wife describes pt as disoriented to time and place. He once asked for peanuts when he was already holding some in his hands. Over the last several days, these confusional states have gone from intermittent (worse in early AM and then PM) to continuous. Per wife, today's hospitalization results from cumulative decline and was not precipitated by an acute event. Wife does not recall any recent medication changes or acute illnesses other than above.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Neurological: Denies HA, neck pain, visual change, difficulties in hearing, talking, swallowing. Wife notes some paraphasic errors and difficulty with abstract thought. Also pt seems to have difficulties with balance and weakness in R side. Pt also has remote hx of head trauma [**2-10**] MVC as child, possibly involving damage to ? temporal lobe, and had some seizures as a child.

        Image studies since admission:
        {'2139-01-27 00:00:00': 'CXR: Left lung is clear. There could be a small region of new opacification at the base of the right lung above the elevated right hemidiaphragm, probably mild atelectasis or superimposition of normal structures. There are no abnormalities convincing for pneumonia. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal on the right. Heart size is normal. Incidental note is made of possible acute fracture of the left eighth rib more obvious on the chest radiograph from [**1-25**], and distortion of the right seventh rib posterolaterally that looks more like a healed fracture.', '2139-01-19 00:00:00': 'CXR: No acute intrathoracic abnormality.', '2139-01-24 00:00:00': 'CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], respiratory motion somewhat degrades the image. The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia. Broken sternal wires are again seen.', '2139-01-25 00:00:00': 'CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], respiratory motion somewhat degrades the image. The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia. Broken sternal wires are again seen.', '2138-02-13 00:00:00': 'CXR-FINDING: Improvement in degree of pulmonary edema with residual peri-hilar haziness. An asymmetric area of alveolar consolidation in the right infra-hilar region. The latter may be due to a resolving area of asymmetrical edema, but infection is also possible in the appropriate setting. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally as well as atele-tactic changes in the left retro-cardiac area.', '2138-02-17 00:00:00': 'CXR-FINDING: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The pre-existing right basal opacity is less dense but slightly more extensive. The pre-existing left retro-cardiac opacity has completely resolved. There is no evidence of interval occurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.'}
