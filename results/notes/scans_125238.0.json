There is a subtle increased opacity in the lower right lung with suggestion of an underlying reticular nodular interstitial pattern. This is relatively focal and localized again to the left lower lobe. No further consolidation is seen elsewhere. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable in size accounting for patient and technical factors. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Question possible early developing opacity in the right lung base as detailed above. If equivocal by clinical standards, consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite for more sensitive evaluation.  CTA chest [**2166-5-22**]: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection. There is mild cardiomegaly. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. The trachea and bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level. Somewhat diffuse bronchial wall thickening is seen but more pronounced in the right lower lobe. A few interstitial septal lines are seen at the lung bases, but there is no alveolar edema or evidence of overt congestive heart failure. There are numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which is pathologically enlarged, seen in the subcarinal, and AP window stations most prominently as well as pretracheal. Numerous sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules are seen in a bilateral, subpleural distribution (e.g. 3:21, 3:28, 3:31, 3:40). There is no pericardial effusion. Osseous structures appear unremarkable. The adrenal glands appear diffusely thickened bilaterally; only imaged on the non-contrast images (2:61, 2:60). IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Findings only of mild congestive heart failure. 3. Scattered sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules, for which followup 12-month chest CT may be indicated if there is high risk for primary or secondary lung malignancy. Otherwise, no follow up is mandated. 4. Likely underlying adrenal hyperplasia, though adrenal glands not fully evaluated on chest CT. Consider adrenal protocol CT or MR for further evaluation if indicated. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.  CXR [**2166-5-22**]: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lung volumes are again diminished, and a previously subtle opacity in the right lung base has dramatically increased in the short interval. There is also now dense left retrocardiac ill-defined opacity. There is no evidence of effusion, although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from view. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged, the bony thorax appears unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Short order significantly increased bibasilar consolidations in a pattern highly suggestive of aspiration.  Echocardiogram [**2166-5-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass\/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity enlargement with mild global hypokinesis c\/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).  CXR [**2166-5-23**]: Compared to the prior study, there is significant improvement in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe opacities most likely consistent with interval resolution of pulmonary edema versus aspiration. Still present bibasilar opacities representing residual of prior process but given the rapid improvement unlikely to represent pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusion is present as well as minimal perihilar vascular engorgement that most likely represents residual of the pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.   "}]
