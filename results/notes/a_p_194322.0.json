[{"0":" As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 634**] was transferred for a acute myocardial infarction. He was medically managed and then brought for a cardiac cath on [**10-25**] which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease. Mr. [**Known lastname 634**] required extensive work-up prior to bypass surgery which included echo, chest CT, vein mapping, carotid U\/S, pulmonary function test and viability study. He also required pulmonary and ENT consult for recent hemoptysis. Since he received Plavix, this was given time to wash-out while he underwent work-up and was eventually brought to the operating room on [**11-1**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. For his chronic systolic heart failure he was placed on coreg.  An ACE-Inhibitor was not initiated due to his history of angioedema from lisinopril. He experienced atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and converted to sinus with amiodarone and betablockade.  He was started on coumadin for recurrent atrial fibrillation, which resolved.  His chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed.  He was seen in consultation by the physical therapy service.  By post-operative day seven he was cleared for discharge to home.  "}]
