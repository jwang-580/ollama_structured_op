[{"0":" Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 yo woman with ESRD\/HD secondary to DM and HTN, CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hx of TIA, who presented to ED after a syncopal episode.  In the ED she was found to have prolonged QTc with episodes of symptomatic torsades de pointes. The patient was discharged home with appropriate cardiac follow-up. . # RHYTHM: Syncope of recent onset was thought to be due to QT prolongation and pause-dependent torsades de pointes of unclear etiology. Given patient age and lack of syncope history prior to recent episodes, prolonged QT syndrome was thought unlikely to be purely secondary to congenital channelopathy. Due to concern that torsades de pointes could be medication-induced, Celexa was discontinued. Electrolyte imbalance was also considered due to patient's ESRD and HD, although electrolytes were only borderline low (K 3.8, Mg 1.7). Potassium was repleted prn in diasylate with goal of 5.0, and magnesium repleted to goal of high-normal. Ischemia from possible ACS may also have contributed to [**Known lastname 74264**] (see below). Patient had brief recurrence of torsades de pointes on [**2112-10-14**] during HD that self-terminated and did not require isoproterenol or temp pacing. EKG was monitored daily and showed persistent QT prolongation that did improve over the course of her hospitalization from 620ms to 469ms. EP was consulted and recommended initiation of verapamil, which the patient tolerated well. ICD placement was deferred due to patient's ESRD, stable condition, and improvement with medical mangement of prolonged QT. Other than episodes of [**Name (NI) 74264**], pt was in NSR throughout hospitalization. Coumadin was initially held due to supratherapeutic INR of 4.6 on admission but later resumed for her history of atrial fibrillation. . # PUMP: Patient had unclear history of congestive heart failure based on TTE and TEE done 3 yrs ago at OSH. TTE performed [**2112-10-14**] showed LVEF of 20% with extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, at least mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate aortic stenosis. Based on cardiac cath findings, wall motion abnormalities and systolic heart failure was consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Patient was fluid restricted and kept on low-salt diet. Daily weights and I\/O's were monitored. No ACE-I was given due to ESRD. On discharge, patient was 64.2kg and had net fluid balance of about positive 600 mL.  She anuric and dependent on HD for fluid removal. . # CORONARIES: Patient had no known coronary artery disease prior to admission but had chemical stress test in [**2111-7-28**] that was normal per patient history. EKG during admission showed loss of R waves in in precordial leads and diffuse ST elevations that were both new compared with EKG from 2\/[**2111**]. Cardiac enzymes were initially elevated and trended until peak of CK 1044, MB 50, TropT 4.50 on [**10-14**] afternoon. It was unclear whether the cardiac enzyme leak was secondary to global ischemia from [**Month\/Year (2) 74264**] or due to primary ACS event that may have led to [**Month\/Year (2) 74264**]. The patient was treated with ASA 325, Plavix 75 mg, heparin gtt, and continued on simvastatin 40 mg. She underwent non-emergent left cardiac cath on [**2112-10-18**] that showed a hazy 80% stenosis in the LAD just distal to takeoff of first septal, in addition to 60% stenosis in proximal D1 and 50% stenosis in mid-RCA. Promus drug-eluting stent was placed in LAD with good effect. . # ESRD: Patient continued to receive M\/W\/F hemodialysis via left AV graft. Patient has been essentially anuric. Electrolytes have been stable since admission. Dialysate adjusted to maintain potassium around 5.0 due to [**Date Range 74264**] arrhythmia. Renal tabs and PhosLo were continued. Patient is on Epo for anemia of chronic disease. . # R FEMORAL HEMATOMA: Hematoma developed around R femoral line placed emergently in ED, likely [**2-29**] supratherapeutic INR. Resolved after administration of vitamin K and pressure dressings. LFT's were not indicative of coagulopathy from liver disease. . # HYPOTHYROIDISM: Due to concern of hypothyroidism contributing to [**Month\/Day (2) 74264**], TSH was checked and wnl (1.0). Levothyroxine was continued at home dose throughout hospital stay. . # DM2: Blood sugars were well-controlled. Patient is not on any insulin or oral hypoglycemics at home. Diabetic diet and sliding-scale insulin was given for glycemic control. . # CODE: FULL  "}]
