[{"0":" 59yo M w\/hx of HTN who presents with new onset afib with RVR with unclear precipitant and respiratory distress, hypoxia.  1. Tachyarrhythmia: Precipitant for this event remained unclear. Infection may have played a role given suggestion of PNA on imaging. The rhthym was felt initally to be most consistent with atrial fibrillation, although there were episodes where the heart rate were regular, and it is uncommon for A-fib to reach rate in 200s. He was initially placed on a nitro drip and admitted to the MICU.  He later received diltiazem and digoxin for rate control, with good improvement - the nitro drip was weaned. HR returned to 70s-80s at rest. However, even minor movement (such as sitting up in bed) triggered bursts of tachycardia to 140s-160s.  These typically self-resolved within seconds of returning to rest.  Adenosine was avoided given risk of SVT\/WPW. TSH was normal at 2.3. Echocardiogram results as above. Cardiology was consulted on the morning following admission and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service. Patient was transitioned to diltiazem 90mg QID and sotalol 120mg [**Hospital1 **] with good control of HR in 70-80s.  He will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.  Patient was also started on warfarin anticoagulation which will be further managed at the [**Hospital 2274**] [**Hospital3 **].  2. Respiratory Distress\/Hypoxia: This was felt most likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of RVR and poor forward flow. However, there was possible contribution from PNA. BNP was elevated in support of volume overload in the lungs. The patient received Lasix boluses PRN. He also received levofloxacin and ceftriaxone given concern for possible PNA. Patient was able to be weaned off supplemental O2 with further diuresis.  He was discharged home with furosemide 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] and will complete a 5 day course of levofloxacin.  3. HTN: Antihypertensives were initially held, but with better control of his HR, he was hemodynamically stable enough for them to be restarted.  Patient was discharged home with diltiazem, furosemide, lisinopril, and sotalol.  "}]
