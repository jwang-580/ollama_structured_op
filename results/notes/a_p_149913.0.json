[{"0":" # GI bleed: Patient intially presented with grossly bloody stool at OSH. Per reports, never had colonoscopy prior to NEBH colonscopy which showed  blood in colon although repeat colonoscopy on [**2145-5-13**] showed no blood.  Tagged red cell scan showed area of bleeding in sigmoid colon.  SHe received a total of 9 units of PRBC at NEBH. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible embolization but upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was hemodynamically stable with hcts 28.5 and 27.5 over 12 hours so IR thought it would be unlikely they would find a bleed at this point as it appeared she was not bleeding profusely any longer. GI was consulted but as no evidence of brisk bleeding did not feel needed to rescope. She was transitioned to the floor but immediately passed a bloody bowel movement and was taken to IR for embolization.  Unfortunately, a source of bleeding was not identified.  Surgery was consulted, but stated she would be a very poor surgical candidate.  After discussion with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and her HCP, [**Name (NI) 1494**], all involved feel we have exhausted reasonable measures to stop the bleeding and we will focus on comfort care now.  She will be discharged to [**Location (un) 8220**] where she will meet with palleative care\/hospice. . # Schizophrenia: Patient takes zyprexa at home.
