HAND XRAY [**2182-12-10**]:  There is equivocal soft tissue swelling in relationship to the PIP joint of the fifth finger and I cannot entirely exclude a subtle intra-articular fracture of the distal portion of this proximal phalanx. Localizing history, which is not available to me, would be helpful in this regard. Exam otherwise normal with no overt fracture or joint space narrowing. Other than the equivocal fifth finger findings there is no change from similar exam [**2182-6-13**].   "}]
