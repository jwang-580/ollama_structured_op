[{"0":" 70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture, with evidence of liver and renal organ damage.  Had several episodes of PEA arrest requiring shocks. Currently, she has been more stable for the past several days, was weaned off the vent and been afebrile x 3 days (Tm 101.5 [**2151-11-11**]).  ACTIVE ISSUES:   # Respiratory failure\/ARDS.  Patient presented with evidence of lobar R-sided pneumonia with rapid progression to severe ARDS requiring maximal ventilatory support. Pt is now s\/p 7 PEA arrests.  We were unable to find a fluid collection amenable to thoracentesis on ultrasound.  Patient extubated on [**11-14**] after long intubated course. Has completed levaquin and vancomycin and meropenem and cefepime 15-day antibiotic course for severe pneumonia. Asthma management with albuterol MDIs; off of systemic steroids. Diuresis also helped with respiratory distress. .  # Persistent fevers: Unknown source, possibly R sided PNA from admission. Not enough fluid on thoraco to tap. Nothing seen on abd\/pelvis CT done on [**11-4**] to suggest a source.  IJ has been replaced, foley has been replaced multiple times. Patient has had blood cultures, sputum, stool, and urine.  Not sure what other source is possible.  Could be a drug [**Month\/Year (2) **].  Will see if afebrile when all antibiotics are stopped.  Afebrile x 3 days.  .  #Tachycardia and HTN: The tachycardia has been responsive to fluid boluses. She was on a significant home regimen of HTN meds, which were restarted s\/p hypotension.  Her HTN and tachycardia are currently controlled. Now taking Labetalol 800 TID and  amlodipine 10mg, as pt is tolerating POs. Could consider continued diuresis as this will also help control blood pressure.  .  #Yeast in urine\/vagina: Foley catheter replaced [**2151-11-6**].  Still yeast in urine.  Now yeast in vagina. S\/p 5-day course of fluconazole 200 IV qd. .  #Anemia: patient Hct has been low for length of stay and interval blood transfusions given.  Patient has been responsive to blood transfusions.   Cause of her low Hct is now known, but there does not seem to be a GI bleed per NG tube suctioning and bowel movement examination.  Loss could be due to being critically ill.  .  # Hyperglycemia. Patient takes 180 units of insulin daily at home, and has been difficult to control.  Adjusted glargine and sliding scale for better blood sugar control while inpatient.  . # Repeated PEA arrests\/shock: (ie: [**11-1**] and [**11-2**]) Patient decompensates precipitously in setting of hypoxia, presumably due to vagal vasodilation.  Responds well to epinephrine (but very sensitive, does not require large epinephrine doses as they send her too hypertensive).  She did have evidence of end-organ damage on labs, with rising Cr and transaminitis, then improved. On multiple occasions, spoke to family and she is full code. Optimizing respiratory status was key to preventing further PEA arrests. .  # Elevated Troponins ?????? Almost definitely due to global ischemia rather than ACS, as there is widespread evidence of hypoperfusion of multiple organs.  Her echo did not show any focal wall-motion abnormalities. Has stabilized with her improvement. .  Code:  Full code, confirmed with family on multiple occasions. Okay with trach and PEG if necessary.  Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 36827**] speaks English and understands the situation, has been kept informed and been key family contact.  "}]
