[{"0":" 58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for continued management of heart failure, respiratory failure. . Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient uses home O2 for presumed pulmonary hypertension, it is believed that this low reserve set him up for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure [**1-5**] MRSA PNA (via + sputum cultures.)  His hypoxia improved with endotracheal ventilation.  Bronchoscopy revealed purulent discharge consistent with pneumonia and suggested blood was [**1-5**] trauma from intubation and not true hemoptysis. He was seen by pulmonary who recommended addl coverage for gram-neg sources of PNA with cefepime (x 8 days) as well as a 3 week course of vancomycin.  He did not tolearte extubation trial and required repeat tracheostomy as he could not sustain adequate oxygenation without it.  Patient is hypercarbic at baseline with PCO2 in 60s.  He has had trouble being off pressure support below [**7-8**] with tachypneic and shallow brething. . Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on admission this was [**1-5**] combined hypovolemic +\/- distributive shock.  He was overdiuresed at the OSH who missdiagnosed his PNA as a CHF exacerbation, and his pressures stabilized without pressors after several fluid boluses.  (5L total) . MRSA PNA ?????? Found to have MRSA in sputum cx at OSH, sputum cx and BAL here grew out MRSA, pulm recomended 3 weeks of vanc and cefepime for 8 days. The last day of Vanc would be [**11-4**].  PUMP: Mr [**Known lastname **] has a history of pulmonary hypertension and borderline RV failure presented with hypotension and OSH echo showed elevated PA consistent with worsened RV failure. Given history of congenital heart disease etiology of RV failure most likely [**1-5**] pulmonary hypertension. His pulmonary hypertension is likely [**1-5**] to worsening VSD or mitral regurgitation. Alternatively, his worsening RV function can also be due to worsen tricuspid regurgitation. No ischemic EKG changes to positive troponins to indicate RV infarct. Bedside echo obtained upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], difficult to interpret, but estimated EF 30-40%.  He was thought to be close to euvolemic on discharge. Because of his severe TR, his baseline euvolemia likely includes some mild dependent edema. . # RHYTHM: Mr [**Known lastname **] was anticoagulated on admissoin with a history of Chronic Afib present on admission,however he was having hemoptysis and rate controlled at the time of admission.  Once his Hct stabilized,we restartaed anticoagulation as with goal INR 2.0 - 3.0 for atrial fibrillation. . # thrush ?????? Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have thrush on admission, this did not resolve with nystatin swish and swallow and he was advanced to fluconazole. . # HL: His lipitor was continued . # Depression\/Anxiety: His abilify was continued   "}]
