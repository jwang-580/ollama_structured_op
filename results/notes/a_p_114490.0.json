[{"0":" In brief, the patient is a 54 year old woman with MUSK Ab+ myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], tracheobroncomalacia, anxiety, and sinus tachycardia who presented with gradual worsening in weakness found to have a UTI whose course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure and intermittent hypoxia.  1.  Dyspnea - admitting differential diagnosis included muscle weakness (from myasthenia or other cause, incited perhaps by UTI), structural abnormalities\/TBM, anxiety, PE (which was ruled out), CAD\/ischemia (no ecg changes, not c\/w history).  Patient had no fever,  leukocytosis, or clear infiltrate to suggest pneumonia as cause.  Patient noted to have mild hypoxemia with respiratory acidosis on admit and is a CO2 retainer at baseline.  A bronchoscopy was performed [**2139-10-28**] to rule out stent obstruction, which revealed a patent stent with minimal mucous impaction.  Patient was followed in the MICU for the first two days of her stay, with neuro consult, with adequate oxygenation and NIF at -80 and vital capacity measurements of >500cc, with assistance of breathing treatments (i.e. nebulizers). Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] exacerbation was not believed to be the sole etiology of her [**Last Name (un) 7186**] of breath.  Klonopin was initiated to control an element of anxiety, with good relief.  Patient receieved her routine administration of IVIG over a three-day course of 50g, 55g, and 55g, initated on [**10-28**].  She was transferred to the neurology floor on [**10-28**].  On [**10-29**], she developed respiratory distress in setting of not using her BIPAP overnight, receiving benzos for anxiety, and SOB.  CXR stable. She was transferred back to the MICU where her PCO2 was found to be 150.  NIFs -80s. improved after placed on BiPap and flumenazil trial to counteract clonazepam 0.25mg given in the AM. given solumedrol 125mg stress dose steroids. She was then transferred to the floor, where she continued to have twice daily NIF and VC measurements (NIF -80s, VC 500-900).  She was weaned off O2, but triggered on [**2139-11-2**] for O2 sat 77% RA and HR 150s while ambulating, likely related to exertion, minimal ventilation, and reflex tachycardia on top of baseline tachycardia.  She was discharged on [**2139-11-3**] with instructions to use 2L NC (while at rest, 93% on room air and 95% on 2L NC. while walking, 87% on room air and 92-94% on 2L NC).  2.  Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] - contributation as above, noted to also have neck weakness.  Was continued on her prednisone, mestinon, cellcept, and Bactrim ppx.  As above, she received a 3-day course of IVIG at 50g, 55g, and 55g, started on [**10-28**]. Azathioprine was started on [**2139-10-29**] to supplement immunosuppression (cellcept, prednisone).  She received bactrim for prophylaxis.  We avoided beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and quinolones due to potential exacerbation of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  3.  Anxiety - patient has history of anxiety and has been on SSRI and benzos in past.  A psychiatry consult was placed, recommending outpatient follow-up.  Patient was started on klonopin tid for anxiety control with good effect.  However, after returning to the MICU for respiratory distress with possible inciting cause of receiving clonazepam 0.25mg that morning, all further benzodiazepines were avoided.  4.  Tachycardia - had intermittent sinus tachycardia (150s when walking, 80s when sleeping) with an unchanged ECG, reportedly at her baseline.  Avoided beta blockade and calcium channel blockade due to myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] history.  5.  Urinary incontinence - chronic problem with recent worsening.  Urine culture [**2139-10-27**] with klebsiella, ciprofloxacin started on [**2139-10-30**]--> changed to ceftriaxone on [**2139-10-31**]. WBC trended down.  She was discharged on Keflex, with total antibiotic course of 7 days.  She was recommended to discuss with her PCP [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13511**] to urogynecology.  6.  Diarrhea - noted to have [**12-24**] month history of diarrhea with subacute\/chronic fecal incontinence, previously attributed to mestinon in past.  Cdiff cultures were negative and extensive stool studies were unrevealing, some studies pending at discharge.  Neuro recommended outpatient MRI C-spine to r\/o trauma given her multiple procedures.  She was continued on loperamide.  7.  Tracheobronchomalacia: followed by IP service, mucolytic increased to TID.  8. DM2: placed on insulin sliding scale for better glycemic control in the setting of steroid use.  "}]
