[{"0":" Assessment and Plan: This is a 47 yo F with recurrent admissions fot line associated bacterimia now presenting with severe back pain and sepsis requiring pressors. . # Sepsis \/ Hypotension \/ Fevers - While the patient did have a downward-trending WBC on admission, her high fevers and hypotension requiring pressors made sepsis the likely cause of her symptoms.  Given her medical history, it was most likely that the source of her sepsis was a line infection. Additionally, blood cultures from and outside hospital showed coag neg staph in multiple bottles.  She was started on cefepime and daptomycin, based off of her medical history.  Neurosurgery and ID were also consulted because of the possibility that the patient could have disciitis.  A CT scan of the lumbar spine was performed and showed erosive changes at L4-5 that were consistent with known chronic discitis.  However, acute infection could not be completely ruled out.  It was noted, after the patient's admission to the MICU, that her blood pressures normally run low and this was kept in mind as we weaned down her pressors.  ID added micofungin to the patient's regimen.  Neurosurgery recommended getting a CRP and a tagged WBC scan, which showed no evidence of acute osteomyelitis, discitis or focal infection.  Also, the patient's venous access line was ethanol-locked, which is what she uses at home.  Three days after her admission, the patient was transferred out of the MICU to the medicine service.  At the time of transfer, all of her blood cultures from this hospital (including fungal cultures) were still pending.  Also, attempts were being made to obtain sensitivities from her cultures at the outside hospital. The bacteria was found to be sensitive to daptomycin. She will need 4 wks total of daptomycin (last dose 08\/04) and to follow-up in ID urgent care clinic in one week when VNA can fax blood culture results to ID doctor (name listed in follow-up instructions) She will need weekly CBC\/ Diff, CK, BUN\/Cr as an outpatient on daptomycin.  # Leukopenia\/thrombocytopenia: ddx includes medication induced (although no major medications which are likely culprits) vs. sepsis (although time course seems unusual).  Of note, her OSH UTI med was macrobid. - will trend values and watch for clinical improvement.  # History of Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism - The patient was taken off of Coumadin in the past due to interactions with antibiotics and her history of frequent hospitalizations with antibiotic treatment.  She was continued on her regimen of Plavix during this admission for her stents.  # Pain control- pt has had chronic back pain and has been taking oxycodone and dilaudid in addition to having a fentanyl patch. Upon consult from pain management team, we started Tizanidine 20mg TID and liquid gabapentin 300mg TID on [**6-6**] as well as a PRN Lidoderm patch. Lido patch was changed to a standing order on the 14th and liquid oxycodone 5mg PRN was also ordered at this time. Pt continued to do well from a pain standpoint and was feeling relatively pain-free and using less dilaudid on [**6-7**]. However, on the night of the 14th, pt reported increased back pain that did not respond go 5mg oxycodone. Oxycodone was increased to 10mg PRN on [**6-8**] and  pt reported increased relief with this dose.  "}]
