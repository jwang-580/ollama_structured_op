CT abd\/pelvis ([**3-25**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Limited non-contrast evaluation. No definite evidence of large fluid collection. 2. Distended gallbladder with gallstones, unchanged.  Renal US ([**3-25**]): [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate the native kidneys to be echogenic and small (right 6.2 cm, left 8.5 cm). An anechoic avascular approximately 1 cm structure is identified in the left kidney laterally, likely a cyst. The transplant kidney measures 10 cm and is located in the right pelvis. There is no hydronephrosis or renal mass. No perinephric fluid is identified. Hyperechogenic foci likely represent sinus fat. IMPRESSION: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for perinephric abscess.  TTE ([**3-27**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  US of the left upper extremity AV fistula ([**3-27**]): 1. Thrombosed arteriovenous graft on the left upper arm and forearm. 2. Patent left brachial and radial arteries. 3. No fluid collections on the left arm.   "}]
