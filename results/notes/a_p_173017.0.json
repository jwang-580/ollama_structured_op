[{"0":" 1. Right Distal Femoral Fracture:  Patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation.  Her right leg was placed in a brace.  Pain was initially controlled with a hydromorphone PCA, although there was concern for patient's ability to comply with PCA.  She was changed to around-the-clock tylenol with morphine IR PO as needed for breakthrough pain.  She was discharged on lovenox 40 mg SC daily for two weeks per orthopedics recommendations.  2. Hypotension:  Occurred post-op in the setting of hypovolemia from blood loss while receiving antihypertensive medications and hydromorphone for pain.  She received 5 units packed red blood cells total, 1 unit fresh frozen plasma.  Although her hematocrit was initially not responding to transfusion, it stabilized and then continued to trend up.  Once stable, she was restarted on enoxaparin SC, clopidogrel, and all her outpatient BP meds except clonidine patch.  Her BP was controlled, although clonidine can be restarted as an outpatient if necessary.  3. Fever\/Leukocytosis:  Felt most likely due to systemic response to her leg trauma.  She was initially started on vancomycin and cefepime empirically, although these were later stopped as she remained stable.  Her fevers and leukocytosis gradually defervesced.  4. Hypoxia:  Patient was maintained on O2 via NC initially.  She did not appear to be volume overloaded on exam, CXR showed no discrete consolidation.  Her oxygen was weaned without difficulty.  Possible explanation is atelectasis \/ shallow breathing in perioperative period.  6. Dispo:  All of the patient's other chronic medical issues were treated per her outpatient regimen with exceptions as noted above.  Patient had her code status changed from DNR\/I to full code for her ORIF.  Afterward, code status was addressed with the patient and her [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3707**].  It was agreed to resume DNR\/I code status.  Based on aspiration risk and video swallow results, she was started on ground solids\/nectar thick liquids with crushed medications.  "}]
