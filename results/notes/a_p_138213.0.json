[{"0":" The patient is an 83 year old female with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by portal htn, grade 1 varices, and prior SMV and PV thrombosis ([**2117**]) s\/p recent RFA admitted with abdominal pain found to have a new right portal vein and SMV thrombus with CT changes concerning for bowel ischemia. . #. SMV and Portal Vein thrombosis with associated bowel wall thickening\/stranding concerning for mesenteric ischemia. The patient presented with abdominal pain and underwent a CT A&P on admission which demonstrated a new occlusive thrombus in right portal vein and SMV with small bowel and cecal wall thickening and stranding  concerning for ischemia\/vasc congestion given occlusion of vessels. Labs were notable for elevated LFTs (114, 127), alk phos 227, doubling of tbili from baseline (to 3.4), lactate 2.7, and INR 1.4. She was given morphine for pain control as well as IV protonix and zofran. She was additionally started on a heparin gtt. She was seen by transplant surgery who recommended serial abdominal exams and trending lactate. Hepatology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended keeping the patient NPO, on heparin with [**Name (NI) **] PTT 60-70. Following the addition of the heparin gtt the patient was noted to have serial hematocrits downtrending, initially 41 with trend to 33.9. Due to GI bleed anticoagulation was stopped. Given the patient's ongoing risk of bleed, the decision was made to without further anticoagulation. Her abdominal exam remained stable throughout her hospitalization. She will follow up in [**Hospital 3585**] clinic for consideration of future anticoagulation and need for follow imaging of the thrombus. . # GI Bleed - The patient was initiated on a heparin gtt as above for portal vein thrombus. She was noted to have melena with HCT drop off 41 to 33. Heparin gtt was discontinued and the patient was transferred to the ICU for EGD. EGD on [**4-22**] demonstrated varices without stigma of bleeding. Otherwise normal EDG to 3rd portion of duodenum. The patient's HCT remained stable between 33-35 and she required no blood transfusions. She had no further evidence of bleeding during her hospitalization. She continues on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for history of varices. . # Right pleural effusion - The patient underwent a thoracentesis with results consistent with hepatic hydrothorax. Micro cultures were negative. She continues on diuretics lasix and spironolactone without evidence of reaccumulation. . #. Cirrhosis, portal gastropathy - the patient's home diuretic regimen of spironolactone 100mg and lasix 10mg daily were held given GI bleed. Initially her lasix was restarted at 40mg and spironolactone at 100mg daily. The patient developed low blood pressure and urine output with this regimen requiring 1L NS and albumin. Her diuretics were held for one day, then restarted at lasix 10mg and spironolactone 50mg with good effect. Her weight should continue to be monitored daily and diuretics adjusted as needed to prevent weight gain for accumulation of ascites. Her chem 7 should be checked on [**5-2**] for further monitoring. . # Atrial Fibrillation with RVR - the patient developed AF with RVR on [**4-26**]. Her blood pressure remained stable with a rate in the 130s. The patient received IV diltiazem 7.5mg with good effect. She was started on diltiazem 15mg QID with holding parameters of BP<100 and HR<60 with subsequent good control of HR. She is being discharged on telemetry for continued monitoring and titration of meds for heart rate control. She underwent a TTE on [**4-30**] which demonstrated a normal EF and no evidence of valvular abnormalities. . # Mood d\/o. - the patient continues on sertraline . The patient is being dishcarged to rehab for continued monitoring on telemetry with blood pressure monitoring and diuretic titration.  "}]
