No evidence of CHF or pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Relative upper [**Name2 (NI) 3630**] lucency and splaying of bronchial vasculature is again noted, likely related to underlying COPD. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left humeral head prosthesis is again noted. Osseous structures appear stable. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. . KUB [**2171-8-28**]: Dilated loops of colon with no air seen in the rectum suggestive of colonic ileus or possible toxic megacolon. Early distal obstruction cannot be excluded secondary to paucity of air noted in the rectum. . CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2171-8-28**]: Liver appears normal. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys appear normal.

Right renal artery stent unchanged in appearance. Small bowel is unremarkable.  Scattered sigmoid diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis. There is gaseous distention of the colon from the cecum through the sigmoid colon where it tapers gradually to the decompressed rectum. No evidence of volvulus, pneumatosis, a transition point or obstructing mass lesion. The ascending colon is dilated up to approximately 10 cm.  Note is made of an anterior midline healed surgical scar.  CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Bladder is distended and appears normal. Uterus is unremarkable. No evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
