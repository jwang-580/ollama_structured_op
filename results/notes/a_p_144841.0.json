[{"0":" Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo male with a history of T1DM s\/p cadoveric renal transplant, chronic RLE ulcers, and IVC filter on coumadin, who was admitted with DKA in the setting of one week of N\/V, diarrhea and fevers.  #. DKA: Thought [**12-31**] infection (MRSA bacteremia and C diff colitis found in workup)  He received aggressive IVF and IV insulin bolus but no gtt.  His gap closed overnight in the ICU. EKG without signs of active ischemia.  He was restarted on his home insulin regimen once gap closed, with no further incidents.  #. R FOOT ULCER\/CELLULITIS: was previously treated with linezolid and followed by podiatry as out-patient; seen by [**Month\/Day (2) 1106**] and podiatry on admission.  He was started on vanco and unasyn on admission, and this was narrowed to just vanco after his culture data returned.  Initial wound swab grew MRSA and was the likely source of MRSA bacteremia. He underwent debridement in OR by podiatry on [**2136-5-31**], cultures sent from OR and also grew MRSA. ID consulted and suggested 6 weeks vancomycin: his wound probes to bone so there was certainly concern for osteomyelitis. Pathology eventually confirmed acute osteomyelitis. He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31564**] of podiatry.  #  MRSA BACTEREMIA:  [**12-31**] sets on admission.  Source likely foot ulcer.  TTE negative.  Surveillance blood cultures neg to date. Treating with 6 weeks vancomycin as above.  #. NAUSEA\/VOMITING, DIARRHEA, C DIFF COLITIS:  sx improved with appropriate tx with flagyl. Will be treated with 2 weeks Flagyl and if diarrhea recurs while on vancomycin, will consider retreating with Flagyl.  #. SOB: sx resolved without further intervention.  No signs ACS or pneumonia.  Low suspicion PE.  No hypoxia  #. Right knee pain: There was initially significant concern for possible septic knee in the setting of MRSA bacteremia; however on further evaluation by rheum, they reported that he had no effusion, no fluid for arthrocentesis.  Their differential included CPPD\/crystalline disease, other musculoskeletal such as meniscal tear, avascular necrosis (chronic steroids), occult fracture. MRI showed no evidence of meniscal or ligamentous injury, non-specific circumferential subcutaneous edema, and only trace joint fluid. His pain improved with conservative management.  #. Coagulopathy: INR 20 on presentation likely [**12-31**] diarrhea and poor PO intake over last week; received 1 unit FFP in the ED as well as vitamin K.  INR improved to 6.  We held coumadin but also gave no further vitamin K in the ICU. His INR was allowed to drift down and was 3.7 on discharge. He will follow up with [**Hospital3 **] who will determine when he will restart coumadin.  #. ARF: Cr 2.1 on admission; with IVF in ED.  Likely prerenal as it improved with appropriate hydration.  Continued prednisone\/prograf for renal allograft. On resumption of his outpatient diuretics, his creatinine started rising again. Diuretics were held as urine lytes suggested this was again prerenal. Given his worsening lower extremity edema and after his creatinine had stabilized around 1.7-1.8, Lasix was restarted at 40mg qd and florinef was stopped.  #. Hx heavy EtOH use: ciwa scale and mvi\/folate\/thiamine; no signs withdrawal so CIWA discontinued.  # T1 DM, uncontrolled with complications:  as above, DKA resolved with appropriate insulin IV in ICU and tx of multiple infections.  # CAD s\/p CABG: continued ASA, Plavix  # Anemia: he was guaiac negative and iron studies were consistent with ACD. Procrit was started in-house, to be continued as an outpatient.  "}]
