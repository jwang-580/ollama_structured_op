[{"0":" 78 year old male with h\/o hypertension, DM on insulin, CKD IV, chronic dCHF who presented to OSH [**10-22**] with one day of fevers, CT scan concerning for pneumobilia so transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].  ERCP done on [**10-24**] with CBD stone\/sludge which was removed, but no pus or fistula as suggested on CT\/US. Found to have klebsiella bacteremia with unclear source but most likey biliary as the admission UA\/CXR at OSH and here were unremarkable. Had daily fevers until [**10-24**] am but has been afebrile since ERCP. Subsequent blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] negative except 1 of 4 bottles on [**10-22**] in ER had CONS, deemed to be contaminant (esp given we had other bacteria isolated from OSH). Since transfer to Gen Med on [**10-24**], has been doing well, no more fevers, BP improved. His home medications reintroduced. His diet advanced. His MS much improved. Got some PT. Given his bacteremia, plan for IV unasyn X14days total (until [**11-4**]) and RUE PICC was placed. Of note, surgery did reccommend outpt cholecystectomy, esp since this appears to be his 2nd complication. Pt has defered this in the past but can be discussed once again. One other issue complicating hospital stay was that he initially recieved fluids given transient hypotension en route to [**Hospital1 18**] and ongoing fevers and concern for sepsis. Then on [**10-24**] am, was wheezing and CXR\/BNP c\/w acute worsening CHF (Echo normal EF, mod-severe MR). Was given IV lasix [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] with improvement in breathing, O2 sats. Creat did remain stable with this (2.4 on admission, 1.8 after fluids, 2.0 after diuresis (baseline)). However, on [**10-26**], he had a bump in his creat, which peaked at 2.8 on [**10-27**]. Renal was consulted given unclear etiology ([**Name (NI) 84518**] 55%, US neg, urine eos neg, I\/Os positive balance, no contrast, no documented hypotension, no nephrotoxins). They felt it may have been due to relative hypotension\/hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis and restarting lisinopril and lasix (got his home PO dose lisinopril 5mg and lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**] am before labs were drawn).  We held his lasix and lisinopril and allowed his BP to be a bit higher to maintain perfusion. His creat improved on his own. Given that his O2 sats were good, we did not resume his lasix on discharge and this can be done over the next few days per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] if his creat remains stable. We also did not resume his lisinopril and this can be resumed after a week or so if BP and creat are good after resuming lasix. He does tend to have hypoK\/Mag, even when he was not getting lasix and this can be monitored.  His family\/wife updated on daily  basis. PCP updated as well and [**Hospital 33857**] transfer to [**Hospital6 **] for IV Abx and short rehab stay. Of note, after being seen by PT, there was some concern about the safety of patient being able to drive a car as outpt and this concern was related to pt's wife and she is asked to further discuss this with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has an outpt cardiologist and nephrologist and he can f\/u with them in the next two weeks.  .. . Below is the daily progress note from the day of discharge for further details according to problem list: . ARF on CKD IV: per OSH records, creat since [**8-26**] has been around 2.0-2.2. Was 2.4 at OSH, got fluids, improved to 1.8, then developed heart failure, got lasix 80mg IV [**10-24**] and [**10-25**], creat stabilized around 2.0-2.2. Resumed on lasix 80mg PO on [**10-26**], dose held [**10-27**]. Also got his lisinopril 5mg dose resumed on [**10-26**] (one dose). -on [**10-26**] afternoon, creat 2.0->2.5-->2.8 on [**10-27**]. By I\/Os pt has been positive. -[**Month\/Year (2) **] 55% and not orthostatic and clinically not dry. renal US unremarkable, urine eos neg. no contrast recently. no documented hypotension. -Holding lasix\/lisinopril per renal as they think relative hypotension in setting of sepsis -creat improved 2.8-->1.9 with holding lasix and lisinopril, will continue to hold and can resume as outpt -renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins . . Allergy to Midline: developed streaking along LUE midline so removed and PIV placed. On [**10-29**], a new PICC placed RUE . . Klebsiella bacteremia\/fevers: Given CT and US findings, initially concern for biliary source. however, LFTs wnl, GB otw normal, and ERCP w\/o evidence of pus or fistula. OSH UA\/UCx negative. CXR also negative on admission. ERCP doesnt think biliary source, but may have been transient bactermia->though unusual why recurrent fevers X3days, it is still most likely the case. will treat for 14days for bacteremia -will continue unasyn per sensitivites. Day [**8-31**]. d\/c'd cipro [**10-25**]. -f\/u blood cx, NTD here (except CONS) -note, repeated CXR after diuresis, no infiltrate -CIS, last temp [**10-24**] am . . CONS bacteremia: only 1\/4 bottles. has h\/o CONS endocarditis BUT since 1\/4 bottles and we already have other source, this is likely a contaminant. Vanc stopped [**10-24**] . . Acute on chronic diastolic HF: [**2-19**] IVfs. s\/p lasix 80IV [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] with some improvement. Off O2. I\/Os suggest pt drinks a lot of fluids. Echo with EF >55% and valvular dz (mod-severe MR) -got lasix 80mg PO home dose on [**10-26**]. Has been held since [**10-27**] given ARF and per renal, cont to hold for a couple days. need close monitoring of creat if resumes (also hypoK) -cont BB, ACE-i held -repeat CXR much improved -I\/Os, daily weights, BP, creat -inhalers prn . . Choledocholithiasis: again as above, ERCP wtih small distal CBD stone, s\/p sphincterotomy and sweep. No pus or fistula seen. per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has h\/o cholecystitis but has deferred CCY in past. -outpt elective outpt ccy per surgery . . HTN: resumed BB (on higher dose at home). Holding ACE-I, BPs ar acceptable and per renal, avoid hypotension in setting of recent bacteremia\/sepsis. Can start as outpt in next couple weeks and monitor creat. . . DM, type II, controlled with complications: sugars here around 150-200 and is on SSI. -cont home lantus 14U qam, humalog SSI, accuchecks, diabetic diet . . Anemia: baseline hgb around 13. Here has been around [**10-28**] but stable. likely due to acute illness and dilutional. Also CKD component -follow trend . . Dementia: baseline oriented and independent. Here is nearly oriented. high risk delirium -nonpharm measures -foley d\/c'd -no narcotics\/sedatives -PT following -reorient frequently -resumed home aricept and namenda . . Hypothyroid: continue home dose synthroid 50mg PO . . Code\/dispo: Full Code. Wife is [**Name (NI) **]: 1-[**Telephone\/Fax (1) 84519**].  PCP. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 20587**]. Cardiology: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 16827**].  Plan is for [**Hospital6 **], was defered over weekend given ARF, however, can go today. .    "}]
