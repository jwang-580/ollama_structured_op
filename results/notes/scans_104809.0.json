CARDIOLOGY: . EKG [**2175-12-11**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Right axis deviation. Low limb lead QRS voltage. RSR' pattern in lead VI. Persistent prominent S waves in the left precordial leads. Modest right precordial lead T wave changes. Findings are consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy\/right ventricular overload. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison. . TTE [**2175-12-12**] IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate global hypokinesis and relative sparing of the basal right ventricular segments. Preserved left ventricular regional and global systolic function. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Mild aortic and moderate mitral regurgitation. . . RADIOLOGY: CXR ([**2175-12-12**]): FINDINGS: Large right thyroid masses again appreciated with calcification and leftward deviation of the trachea. Numerous rounded masses within the chest bilaterally are again depicted consistent with known metastatic disease. No significant effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Double density with regard to the cardiac shadow is consistent with a large hiatal hernia. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is detected. . CTA Chest ([**2175-12-13**]): IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. Large pulmonary artery measuring 3.4 cm, greater than the aorta. The heart is enlarged with large atria bilaterally, right ventricle greater than the left, although this has not changed in appearance since [**8-14**]. Septal thickening consistent with fluid overload. 3. Large pleural effusions, right greater than left, much worse than in [**Month (only) **]. Significant right and left lower lobe atelectasis. 4. Numerous metastatic pulmonary nodules as before. 5. Hiatal hernia. . CT Chest ([**12-21**]): pending   "}]
