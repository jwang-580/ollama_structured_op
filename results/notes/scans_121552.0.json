There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.   [**2167-4-22**] COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was normal. The LAD had a long lesion in the proximal\/mid vessel to 80%. The LCx had a distal 60% stenosis.  The RCA had a mid 40% lesion.  There was a total occlusion proximally of the PDA which filled via LAD collaterals with probable diffuse disease. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated central aortic pressures of 149\/98 mmHg. 3. Successful PTCA and placement of overlapping 3.0x33mm and 2.5x8mm Cypher drug eluting stents in the proximal-mid LAD were performed.  The stents were postdilated using a 3.5mm diameter balloon proximally and a 3.0mm diameter balloon in the mid and distal regions.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis. (See PTCA comments.) 4. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using an 8 Fr Angioseal VIP device.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Placement of drug eluting stents in the proximal-mid LAD.   "}]
