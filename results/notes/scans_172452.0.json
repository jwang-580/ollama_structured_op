CXR [**10-23**]: Pacer placement with no evidence of complication. Small right pleural effusion. . ECG [**10-22**]: Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block with QRS duration  of 122 milliseconds. The patient now has T wave inversion in leads V3-V6 that was not seen in tracing #1. These changes are non-specific. . ECHO [**2165-10-22**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-1-26**], a pacer, TR and pulmonary hypertension are now seen. .   "}]
