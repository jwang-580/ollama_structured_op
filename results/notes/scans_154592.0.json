There is a stable appearance of bibasilar linear opacities, which likely reflect atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No definite pleural effusions are appreciated. Heart size is grossly unchanged. Mediastinal contour is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Upper lobe lucency and splaying of bronchovasculature likely reflects underlying emphysema. Extensive ribcage deformity and thoracic kyphosis are again noted. IMPRESSION: No significant change. No evidence of pneumothorax. . EKG: [**2205-1-2**]: Sinus rhythm. Q-T interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2204-12-25**] the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change. . CXR: [**2205-1-2**]: Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the examination. While there is some obscuration by overlying chest cage there may be new right perihilar consolidation. Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the examination. Multiple healed rib fractures are seen on both sides of the chest. The heart is borderline enlarged. There is no abnormality of the imaged pleural surfaces. Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not focally dilated. No pneumothorax.    "}]
