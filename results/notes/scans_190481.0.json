The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy. There is periventricular white matter hypodensity and subcortical white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The basilar cisterns are preserved. There is no definite evidence of acute fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.  C-spine CT: There is no definite evidence of acute fracture. The vertebral body heights are preserved. Multilevel degenerative changes are identified including severe disc space narrowing and marginal osteophyte formation. There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C7 on T1. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Calcification posterior to the spinous process of C7 is identified and may represent sequelae of prior trauma. The visualized lung apices are clear.  RUQ u\/s: There is increased echogenicity of the liver consistent with fatty infiltration. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The common bile duct measures 3 mm. The gallbladder is normal in appearance.  There is no evidence of cholelithiasis, pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening. The pancreas demonstrates mild ductal dilatation measuring up to 3 mm. The tail is obscured by overlying bowel gas.  Abd\/pel CT: There is bibasilar atelectasis with patchy opacities that may represent aspiration. There is a hiatal hernia with a dilated upstream esophagus. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. A calcified granuloma in the left lobe of the liver is identified. The spleen, adrenal glands, gallbladder and kidneys are unremarkable. There is moderate pancreatic ductal dilatation measuring up to 5 mm in diameter. No definite pancreatic mass is identified, although this study is not tailored for this evaluation. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening.  Calcifications of the descending aorta and its branches are noted. There is no free fluid or free air. Incidental note is made of an anterior abdominal wall fat-containing hernia (3, 54). Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and its branches are noted. CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. The appendix is normal. The bladder contains a Foley catheter. The uterus is unremarkable. BONE WINDOWS: There are extensive degenerative changes identified. No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion noted. Periosteal amorphous new bone formation posterior to the right inferior pubic ramus is noted. However the cortex is intact. Similar changes to the left side are also identified to a lesser degree. These are likely post-traumatic in nature.   "}]
