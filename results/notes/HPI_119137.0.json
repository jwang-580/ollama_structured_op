[{"0":"  [**2131-12-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-2-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime \/ Aztreonam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hemodynamic instability s\/p VATS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: VATS, thoracotomy, chest tubes, BAL, intubation  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s\/p allogeneic transplant, s\/p DLI with subsequent severe GVHD (diagnosed via transjugular liver biopsy) originally admitted on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and fall, now with prolonged loculated hemothorax s\/p R VATS converted to open thoracotomy, evacuation and decortication. . Prior to this hospitalization, patient discharged on [**12-16**] for suspected graft versus host disease that was diagnosed with transjugular liver biopsy.  Hospital course on that admission was complicated by a tension pneumothorax following biopsy which required a pigtail catheter on [**2131-12-4**] which did not resolve pneumothorax and a surgical chest tube was placed [**12-4**]. Following this pt developed a hemothorax and a significant drop in hematocrit however pneumothorax did not improve and an adidtional Due chest tube was placed [**12-5**]. Chest tube was eventually d\/c'd on [**2131-12-16**] and a CXR prior to discharge was notable only for a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax and stable small right-sided loculated pleural effusion. . During her follow-up visit with her Oncologist pt was noted to have weight loss (lost approx 40lbs over the past 3 months) that was attributed to her GVHD. Pt was admitted to BMT service on [**12-30**] for failure to thrive and initiation of TPN. On chest x-ray pt was noted to have a pleural effusion on the right, a follow up CT chest was notable for multi loculated right pleural effusion. IP and CT surgery were consulted, and decided at that time to undergo VATs due to the possibility of hemothorax. Pt received 1u PRBC, 2u plts prior to going to the OR on [**1-1**]; during VATs right lower lobe was notable for patchy parts of necrosis, and there was copious bleeding. VATs was converted to open posterolateral thoracotomy, pt was transfused 5u PRBC, 2u plt, 4u plasma, 1u Cryoprecipitate and then taken to the TICU. Tissue samples demonstrated Gram negative rods and Gram Positive Cocci. Patient was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Flagyl on [**1-2**]. A BAL was performed which demonstrated gram Positive Cocci, Gram Positive Rods, Gram Negative Rods. Pt noted to be hypotensive with systolic BP to 78. Patient was started on pressor therapy with Phenylephrine. . On [**1-3**] AM she was weaned off of pressors. However that afternoon while she was being repositioned she developed atrial fibrillation with vent rates to 180s and hypotension to 80s. She received adenosine push 6 mg IV. She had approx 4 sec asystolic pause and then afib to 150-170s. She was shocked with 200J. Her blood pressure transiently improved however her HR was still in 120s. She was given amiodarone 150 mg IV bolus followed by loading drip. She also received lopressor 5mg x2, neosynephrine drip, and IV fluid bolus. Cardiology consult was obtained and they recommened completion of amio IV loading and possible elective DCCV.  Given patients' multiple medical issues and complicated picture patient was transferred from the thoracic ICU to the medical ICU on [**1-4**]. On arrival to MICU pt was afebrile with HR 136 AFRVR, BP 123\/85 CMV\/AC 450x18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. She was able to communicate that she did not have any shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain. She nodded yes to back pain. Her husband stated that patient experienced decreased apetite and generalized weakness prior to hospitalization but did not experience fevers, chills, SOB, chest pain. . In the MICU patient was continued on antibiotics. ID was consulted. Hemodynamic improved and patient was extubated on [**2132-1-9**]. Patient was transferred back to the primary BMT service for furthur care.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive ALL, status post allogeneic transplant with evidence of disease recurrence.  Her last dose of cyclosporine was on [**2131-7-28**] and last dose of prednisone was on [**2131-7-24**].  She has not had any clear evidence of GVH since tapering off her immunosuppression.  The patient's bone marrow biopsy in the setting revealed areas of extensive confluent necrosis and immature mononuclear cell infiltrates, consistent with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly reactive for CD10.  Chimerism studies revealed that she was approximately 99% donor.  She still was noted to have the normal abnormal gene rearrangement 922 and two out of 100 nuclei were examined.  She was ultimately admitted on [**2131-8-10**] for part A of hyper-CVAD regimen (without CNS treatment) with Gleevec.  She is still recovering from her treatment.  She does have some mild progression of her peripheral neuropathy in the setting of vincristine that she received with her most recent cycle of hyper-CVAD. . - GVHD  "}]
