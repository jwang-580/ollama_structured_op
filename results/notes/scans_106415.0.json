Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with mild vascular congestion suggested. . EKG: NSR at 94, NANI, low limb lead voltage, poor RWP (old); no significant change from prior. . TTE [**2107-11-14**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small circumferenital pericardial effusion. . Renal ultrasound [**11-13**]:  No new findings. . CT Chest [**11-15**]:  On CT, there is no evidence of air embolism. Cardiomegaly, mild axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of subsequent atelectasis, patchy lower lobe predominant parenchymal opacity is potentially suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and atelectasis. No pathologic air collection in the mediastinum and the lung interstitium. . CT Head [**11-15**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction. There is no hydrocephalus. 2. Opacification of sphenoid sinus, maxillary, ethmoid air cells and nasopharynx, most likely related to recent intubation. . CT Head [**11-17**]:  1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious major territorial acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. If there is continued concern, MR of the head with diffusion-weighted imaging sequence is more sensitive in the detection of acute stroke. 2. Diffuse opacification of the sphenoid sinus, nasopharynx, the maxillary and the ethmoid air cells partly related to mucosal thickening, secretions from intubation. However, patient also had a left antrochoanal polyp in the past, which is incompletely assessed on the present study. 3. Discontinuous foci in the left parietal bone may relate to thinning of the bone, from arachnoid granulations or other etiology, to correlate with any history of surgery. However, this appearance is unchanged compared to the prior CT sinus study done on [**2102-10-19**]. . RUE US [**11-20**]:  Although subclavian vein not evaluated, remainder of right upper extremity venous system appears normal with no evidence of DVT, and DVT would be likely in the subclavian vein given respiratory variation and normal appearance of remainder of the study. . MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-21**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates changes of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for acute infarct. 2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease. . KUB [**11-25**]:  1. Severely limited examination demonstrates changes of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old left frontal encephalomalacia without evidence for acute infarct. 2. Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease. . KUB [**11-26**]:   There is no evidence of free air. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right femoral catheter remains in place. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is nonspecific bowel gas pattern. . Portable Abdomen XR [**11-29**]:  There is no evidence of ileus, small or large bowel obstruction. . Abdominal US [**12-6**]:  Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound with no findings to suggest the cause of the patient's pain. . CT Abd\/Pelvis [**12-6**]:  1. Small thrombus within the IVC and at the junction of the right common iliac vein and transplanted renal vein. 2. Diffuse mesenteric stranding with no small or large bowel pathology identified. . CT Head [**12-11**]:  1. . No acute intracranial abnormality. 2. Partial opacification of mastoid air cells bilaterally, maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, partly polypoidal. . CT Abd\/Pelvis [**12-11**]:  1. Very large spontaneous hematoma involving a majority of the left hepatic lobe. A small amount of perihepatic hematoma and scattered areas of blood within the mesentery and along the left pericolic gutters tracking into the pelvis. No definite site of active extravasation identified. 2. Branches of left portal vein are attenuated and not well visualized in the midst of the hematoma but are patent. 3. No change in small 1.5 cm thrombus within the infrarenal IVC. Second separate smaller thrombus in the right common iliac vein near the transplant renal vein anastomosis on the prior study not definitely visualized and may have cleared with anticoagulation.  4. Atelectasis of both dependent lower lobes. 5. More confluent consolidative opacity of the superior right lower lobe could be explained with atelectasis but is concerning for possible area of aspiration or pneumonia. . CT Abdomen [**12-16**]:  Limited study but no gross evidence of obstruction. . CXR [**12-19**]:  There is interval development of vascular engorgement, perihilar opacities, and bibasilar opacities, left more than right, findings which might be consistent with interval progression of pulmonary edema. Evaluation after diuresis is recommended to exclude the possibility of underlying infectious process.   "}]
