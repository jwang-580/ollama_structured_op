[{"0":" This is a 57 year old with a history of ulcerative colitis admitted with left lower extremity DVT and extensive bilateral PE. . # DVT\/PE: Extensive emboli involving all pulmonary lobes and DVT in LLE found on LENI and CTA chest at outside hospital. Possibly provoked by immobility with travel although could also be considered unprovoked. Patient was intially managed with lovenox and coumadin.  However, ECHO performed upon transfer showed mobile clot in IVC and RA.  Lovenox and coumadin were held and patient was transferred to the CCU where he received tPA infusion 100 mg over 2 hours on [**11-14**].  Heparin gtt was restarted once his PTT was < 60 and he received coumadin the day after his tPA infusion after having no evidence of bleeding complications.  Repeat ECHO showed resolution of prior visualized clot suggesting successful thrombolysis.  He remained hemodynamically stable throughout admission. He had no O2 requirement and no subjective SOB.  He was transitioned to subQ lovenox at 1 mg\/kg dosing [**Hospital1 **] 2 days after his tPA. He remained in house for close monitoring given significant clot burden and persistent discomfort in L calf from DVT. Vascular surgery was consulted who recommended CT venogram to evaluate for anatomic cause of current clot.  Venogram showed no thrombus in IVC, iliacs, or proximal femoral veins or anatomic abnormality to explain his significant clots.  While in house his LLE was wrapped sequentially with ace bandages and he was given a prescription for graded compression stockings. . Given that patient's clots seem to be unprovoked and given the severity of his clots including clot in transit, he may require lifelong anticoagulation. As an outpatient he will need follow up of the labs sent from his first hospital as a hypercoaguable work up.  He is scheduled to follow up with vascular and pulmonary as an outaptient. He reports being up to date on age appropriate cancer screening but this should be readdressed with his PCP. . # Ulcerative colitis: Currently inactive. Patient had been off his maintainence medication mesalamine as he felt it made no difference in his course.  It was offered to restart this during his hospitalization but he decided not to restart. He can discuss this further with his primary caregivers as an outpatient. . # Low attention liver lesions: Noted incidentally on CT venogram.  Benign in appearance according to initial read from radiology. Could consider follow up imaging as an outpatient with a triphasic CT scan or MRI of liver per PCP.  "}]
