[{"0":" 76 yo F with lupus nephritis, CKD on HD, CAD s\/p CABG, HTN, rectro-vag fistula who presented from PCP with acute respiratory distress.  # Hypoxia:  This had resolved by the time she came to the floor.  DDx includes infection, hypervolemia, CHF exacterbation. Unclear cause, not vol o\/l on exam or on imaging, CT without clear consolidation though patchy infiltrates with ground glass opacities. Got CTX, levo and vanc in ED. UTI on UA, Bactermia on BCX. SIRS physiology could precipitate acute respiratory distress that quickly resolved with IVF and abx. Unlikely that PNA would resolve so fast.  CHF not likely as improved with fluids.  Gas 7.41\/44\/290 on NRB. Patient was initially on 4L nasal cannula but weaned smooth to room air within 1.5-2 days. Patient was initially treated with Vanc\/cipro\/flagyl and when blood cultures grew our GNR\/GPR likely clostridium vs. bacillus, infectious disease recommended Vanc\/Cipro\/Meropenem.  This was narrowed to vanc\/ceftaz\/flagyl after speciation.  Respiratory status greatly improved after fluid removal at HD. . Bacteremia: Clostridium Perfringens, E. Coli, proteus, and strep viridans were isolated from her blood as well as providencia from her urine. Her source was likely the RV fistula, especially in setting of rectal bleeding in ED. She was initially on vanc\/cipro\/[**Last Name (un) 2830**], however once cultures and sensitivities were identified she was switched to vanc\/ceftaz\/flagyl for dosing at HD. Her RV fistula was found to be nonsurgical on consult. Surveilance cultures turned negative quickly. . Plan going forward: -Continue to dose Vanc\/Ceftaz at HD for a total of a 4 week course -Continue PO flagyl for 4 week course . # Hypotension: Septic shock was most likely etiolgy with UTI and high grade bacteremia as precipitating event. Unclear what baseline bp's are, but 90-100 on floor.  Prior notes with bp 120-140's, and given CRF, likely runs higher. Got 1L in ED, looked hemoconcentrated on hct.  Consider hypovolemia with hct drop, though less likely, no acute s\/sx significant bleeding. Patient was initially bolused gently given her dialysis-dependent state, although she does make some urine. Patient was kept on antibiotic course per above. Urine culture also ultimately grew out GNR >100,000. Patient's anti-hypertensives were initially held. She was restarted on low dose metoprolol. She eventually became normotensive with IV abx. . # Thrombocytopenia: She has known thrombocytopenia (likely [**2-22**] lupus) which has been slowly decreasing over years and was around 90's in [**2100**]. On admission it was 44 and nadired at 35K with stopping her heparin and treating her sepsis this increased and stabilized in the 50's. Hematology\/Oncology saw patient in the MICU and recommended serologies to evaluate for heparin induced thrombocytopenia which was negative.  We continued to hold her heparin in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Differential includes sepsis induced marrow suppresion, MDS in this older patient. . Plan going forward: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] to arrange follow-up with Hem-onc . # CRF: Cr slightly up from baseline, likely slightly hemoconcentrated initially. Responded well to gentle rehydration. patient underwent hemodialysis on her home T\/Th\/Sat schedule with no issues. Continue renagel, iron and renal diet. . # Rectal Bleeding\/Anemia:  Hct to 35 on repeat after blood found during PR tylenol dosing.  Known hemorrhoids.  GI was made aware, no acute need for scoping given this is a chronic issue and patient's hematocrit remained stable. Given her coronary artery disease, transfusion goal 30.  She never required transfusion and her hct was 38 on the day of discharge. . # Lupus: Continued plaquenil, prednisone . # Gout: Continued home allopurinol . # HTN: Restarted on metoprolol 6.25mg . # CAD: s\/p CABG, continue home meds of statin, ASA, Plavix. Holding BB as above. .   "}]
