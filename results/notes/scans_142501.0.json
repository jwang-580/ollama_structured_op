Blood Cx [**2146-5-23**]: Pending  CXR: CONCLUSION: 1. The NG tube appears to be folded on itself within the esophagus and should be repositioned. The ET tube has its tip approximately 90 mm from the carina and needs repositioning. 2. Heart is enlarged and the mediastinum is widened. If there is clinical suspicion of mediastinal vascular injury, cross-sectional imaging is recommended. 3. Indistinct pulmonary vasculature may represent pulmonary edema. Other possibilities like infection or aspiration are not excluded.  ECHO: The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global biventricular hypokinesis.  CT_Head: IMPRESSION: Very limited study without evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction differentiation (where visualized), and demonstrating patent foramen magnum. Recommend MR for more detailed evaluation of possible hypoxic injury.  EEG: Pending   "}]
