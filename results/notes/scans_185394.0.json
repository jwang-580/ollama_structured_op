There is no evidence of underlying periosteal reaction, osteopenia or cortical destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the DIP joints and great toe IP joint as well as the intertarsal joints. Note is made of both plantar and dorsal calcaneal spurs. Degenerative changes are also seen at the tibiotalar joint.  RIGHT FOOT: No soft tissue abnormalities appreciated on this right foot x-ray. No evidence of subcutaneous gas. No evidence of periosteal reaction, osteopenia or cortical destruction to suggest osteomyelitis. Arterial calcifications are visualized.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the IP joints, intertarsal joints and tibiotalar joint. Plantar and dorsal calcaneal spurs are also seen in the right foot.  --------------- [**2167-7-10**] CXR -  Bibasilar atelectasis.
