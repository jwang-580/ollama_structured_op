[{"0":" A 74 year-old man with COPD, s\/p right pneumonectomy 3 weeks prior to this, now presenting with increasing dyspnea and worsening O2 requirement who was found to have a LLL consolidation at rehab and was admitted to ICU for hypoxemia requiring non-rebreather.  # Hypoxemia\/respiratory distress He has poor pulmonary reserve given the recent right pneumonectomy and underlying COPD. The clinical picture and imaging studies were consistent with pneumonia. We started empiric treatment for HAP with vancomycin and Zosyn. In addition we treated for possible COPD flare with standing nebs and solu-medrol. His respiratory status continued to decline and he was intubated in the late morning on the first hospital day. Once intubated, he maintained good oxygen saturations. We ordered a CTA on the first hospital night to further assess the pneumonia and pneumonectomy site; in addition, there was concern for PE given his post-operative status and rapid respiratory decline. There were air fluid levels in the right thoracic cavity, concerning for broncho-pneumonectomy fistula. CT surgery was consulted and placed a right-sided chest tube, immediately draining 1L of exudative fluid. This was sent for culture. He also underwent bronchoscopy; there was no evidence of air leak. The final read from the CTA returned positive for PE and he was started on heparin drip. Despite these interventions, his oxygenation, ventilation, and overall clinical status continued to decline and his code status was changed to CMO, he expired a few hours after (time of death 2:10pm [**2184-4-23**])  # Hypotension On the first hospital day, he maintained SBPs in the 80s. His clinical picture was felt to be consistent with evolving pneumonia, possibly progressing to sepsis, and thus on the second hospital night he was bolused with IVF for total of 5L. Initially, his systolic BP improved to 90s with fluids; however, over the course of the night and into the following morning, the blood pressure dropped to 70s. At this time, dopamine was started through his left midline. A right subclavian CVL was placed and he was started on levophed. Blood pressure continued to decline despite the levophed, requiring addition of vasopressin to maintain MAPs >60.  Patient was eventually on three pressors with a MAP in the 20s.  At that point he was made CMO per above.  # Transaminitis and coagulaopathy This developed in the setting of evolving sepsis. In addition, he was noted on TTE to have moderate TR and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, and it is not clear if congestive hepatopathy from right-sided heart failure might also be contributing to the severe transaminitis (ALT 5200 and AST 6700 with TB 1.6). Likely this was shock liver from hypoperfusion.  # Acute renal failure His creatinine rose from 0.8 at admission to 2.2 to 3.7 just prior to death. The ARF was likely the result of sepsis and renal hypoperfusion. As above, there was no response to IVF or pressors.  # Atrial fibrillation This was a recent diagnosis per patient, occurring perioperatively. He was continued on amiodorone at home dose. Metoprolol was held due to hypotension. Anticoagulation with ASA and Lovenox was held when his clinical status worsened.  He was started on an amio gtt for rate control.  # Lung cancer He was recently diagnosed with squameous cell lung cancer, s\/p right pneumonectomy.  # Patient expired on [**2184-4-23**].  "}]
