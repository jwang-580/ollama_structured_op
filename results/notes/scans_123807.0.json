There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III\/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. AT LEAST moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened\/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; at least moderate (and probably significantly more) mitral regurgitation  [**9-9**] CT abd\/pelvis with IV contrast:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is stable. The lung bases are otherwise clear. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable. Note is again made of a small right renal hypodensity measuring 6 mm, likely representing a renal cyst. There is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca.  A large left retroperitoneal hematoma, now measures 8 (transverse) x 7 (AP) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing for measurement differences, has not changed in size compared to the prior study in terms of size. No areas of active extravasation are noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of the retroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging. No new hemorrhage is identified. The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable. Heavy calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted, and a focal area of stenosis at the level of the pancreas is additionally noted.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis. A Foley balloon is present within the bladder. The rectum and sigmoid colon are grossly unremarkable.   IMPRESSION: Large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentially unchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hours prior. No CT evidence of active extravasation     "}]
