[{"0":" Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 86613**] is a 72 year-old male who presented intubated from an outside hospital with positive cardiac biomarkers and LLL PNA.  #Type 2 Myocardial Infarction: Patient was transferred from outside hospital on heparin drip with concern for NSTEMI.  After admission cardiac biomarkers trended down.  Troponin T at OSH was 0.758 and repeated values at [**Hospital1 18**] were 0.51 to 0.33. CKMB at [**Hospital1 18**] was within normal limits.  Patient did not complain of chest pain since extubation on [**1-8**].  Ischemic disease thought to have been precipitated by infection.  Patient was initially loaded on clopidogrel and continued on 75mg daily. Patient underwent Cardiac Catheterization [**1-10**] which demonstrated mid-distal anterolateral hypokinesis and one vessel disease in the mid LAD, 80% stenosis. After insufficient expansion with angioplasty, cutting balloon rotablade was employed and then an 2.75x15mm BMS was placed with good angio result noted afterwards. LVEDP 15-20.  Patient will need to continue on plavix for one year, not to be stopped unless approved by his cardiologist.  He will follow up with a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **] in one month. Patient will need a repeat echocardiogram 4-6 weeks.  #Pneumonia: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-7**] intubated on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for pneumonia.  Chest x-ray confirmed left lower lobe opacity consistent with pneumonia.  Patient was successfully extubated on [**1-8**] and required supplemental oxygen for several days.  Patient's pneumonia was treated with antibiotics for 7 days.  Initial ceftriaxone\/azithromycin treatment from OSH was changed to vancomycin\/cefepime\/azithromicin at [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for hospital acquired pneumonia.  Azithromycin was stopped on [**1-9**] due to prolonged QTc and low suspicion for atypical infection. Negative blood cultures and rapid improvement caused team to discontinue vancomycin and transition back from cefepime to ceftriaxone, which was last given on [**2183-1-13**].  [**Last Name (un) **] Legionella, varicella, flu, blood cultures, and urine cultures were negative throughout admission.  Sputum culture revealed only normal flora; patient had already started antibiotic treatment at outside hospital prior to sputum sample.  #Atrial Fibrillation. Per patient's daughter, he is always bradycardic.  He does not take any nodal agents at home.  CHADS2 score of 4 (CHF, HTN, TIA, age) concerning for stoke risk, but patient is chronic alcoholic and a fall risk which may be why he was not anticoagulated on coumadin.   Patient was in atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response throughout admission.  He was transitioned from the heparin drip to coumadin.  Patient had presumably not been on coumadin in the past due to alcohol abuse and fall risk, so PCP may decide to discontinue long-term anticoagulation.  PCP will follow up within several days of discharge.  Visiting nursing services have been arranged to check INR and evaluate for safety as well as drug compliance. TSH was low during admission and should be rechecked as outpatient once acute illness has resolved.  #Rash. Dermatology was consulted at outside hospital for diffuse rash; biopsy suggested focal interface change consistent with drug eruption or drug-induced lupus erythematosis.  Drug-induced lupus more likely given subsequently positive [**Doctor First Name **].  Dermatology suggested amlodipine or lisinopril as possible culprits. Lisinopril had previously been discontinued on [**2183-1-1**] and amlodipine was stopped [**2183-1-6**] at OSH admission.  Rash began 1 month ago as vesicles which coalesced.  Rash was intermittently pruritic and painful.  [**Hospital1 18**] Dermatolgy consult stated that Drug Induced Lupus may persist for days\/months following discontinuation of offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  Negative anti-histone antibody makes drug-induced SLE less likely and sub-acute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) more likely. Anti-Ro and -[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 32545**] are pending and will help support diagnosis of SCLE.  Patient was treated with 0.1% triamcinolone cream during admission with some improvement in rash noted throughout hospitalization.  #COPD. Patient was treated for COPD throughout stay with albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers as needed and twice daily fluticasone\/salmeterol.  #Blood pressure. Patient was initially hypotensive on admission.  Patient has chronic hypertensive history, but his lisinopril and amlodipine have been stopped out of concern for rash effect.  Patient was discharged on valsartan 80mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg after becoming hypertensive the day prior to discharge.  # Prolonged QTc. Likely medication side-effect.  We also considered contribution of ischemic heart disease.  Azithromycin was stopped for long QTc and this resolved.  #Hyponatremia Presented with mild hyponatremia to 132, likely due to volume loss.  Sodium normalized during hospitalization.  #EtOH abuse. Patient reportedly was having alcohol withdrawal symptoms at outside hospital.  Patient did not require diazepam for CIWA scale at [**Hospital1 18**] after sedative midazolam was stopped post extubation.  Patient was placed on folate and thiamine supplementation.  # Glaucoma. Patient was treated on Latanoprost throughout admission and discharged back to home bimatoprost\/timolol regimen.  "}]
