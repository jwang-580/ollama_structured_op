Patient was noted to be hypoxic on routine vitals with O2 saturation of 70% on 5 litres nasal cannula. He was placed on a 100% non-rebreather with O2 saturations gradually improving to 95% over several minutes. Rest of the vitals at the time were HR:128, RR:22, BP:125\/57. ABG on non-rebreather was 7.25\/67\/80. Patient received aggressive suctioning that yielded 20cc of what appeared to be gastric contents. On [**2138-8-3**], patient had been started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia based on increased O2 requirement, infiltrates on chest x-ray, and low-grade fevers. Of note, patient has failed gastric and duodenal stenting and continues to have persistent gastric outlet obstruction with pooling of secretions, and was felt to have intermittent aspiration of these secretions. An NG tube was placed for persistent obstruction. However, on the day of transfer, patient's NG tube was found to have not been functioning, and was pulled. . Patient is on furosemide at home for unclear reasons, but this had been held 4 days prior to transfer due to fluid-responsive hypotension in setting of gastric outlet obstruction. He had not received any fluid boluses since [**2138-8-3**]. His fluid intake over the past 24 hours consisted of D5W for hyponatremia and TPN.
