Patient is intubated with secretions in the posterior nasopharynx. Prevertebral soft tissue appears within normal limits. Extensive opacification of the right greater than left maxillary sinuses is noted. Slight atelectatic appearance of the right maxillary sinus is better depicted on accompanying head CT, suggestive of chronic sinusitis. There is no focal thyroid lesion. Deep cervical soft tissues are unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy. Lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.  CT Head [**2197-3-30**]: NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, midline shift, or acute hydrocephalus. There is no major vascular territorial infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Prominent right frontal extra-axial space with mild mass effect on the right frontal lobe as well as right frontal osseous cortical thinning likely represents an arachnoid cyst. Tiny hypodensity in the left basal ganglia is likely a dilated perivascular space. Suprasellar and basilar cisterns are patent. There is extensive mucosal thickening within the right maxillary sinus with a slight atelectatic appearance to the bony sinus, suggestive of chronic sinusitis. Mild mucosal thickening is also noted in the left maxillary sinus and ethmoidal air cells. Remainder of paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. Soft tissues and globes are intact. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Right frontal arachnoid cyst. 3. Likely chronic paranasal sinus disease.  Chest x-ray [**2197-3-30**]: CHEST, AP: Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube has side port in the distal esophagus and tip just beyond the gastroesophageal junction. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are clear. IMPRESSION: ETT in standard position. NGT at GEJ, please advance.  MRI\/MRV\/MRA Head [**2197-3-30**]: MRI OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema, intra-axial masses, mass effect or infarction. Again seen is an arachnoid cyst anterior to the right frontal lobe (8:19), unchanged from the prior CT. The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. There is circumferential mucosal thickening at right maxillary sinus with a central hypointense signal, likely representing inspissated secretions or fungus ball. There is a mucus retention cyst at the anterior wall of the left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. MRV OF THE HEAD: There is no evidence of deep or superficial cortical or dural sinus venous thrombosis. The right transverse sinus is dominant, the left appears hypoplastic without evidence of thrombosis. There is a small Pacchioni granulation in the left transverse sinus (1103:86). MRA OF THE HEAD: There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, dissection, aneurysm or vascular malformation of the intracranial vertebral arteries, basilar arteries, carotid arteries, circle of [**Location (un) 431**] or their major branches. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, edema or infarction. 2. There is no evidence of intracranial venous thrombosis. 3. Mucosal thickening of the right maxillary sinus with central hypointense signal, likely representing inspissated secretions from chronic sinusitis or less likely a fungus ball.  Chest X-ray [**2197-3-30**]: CHEST, AP: New orogastric tube has side port in the distal esophagus and tip just beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Endotracheal tube remains 5 cm from the carina. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. IMPRESSION: OGT at GEJ; this may be advanced a few centimeters for optimal positioning.  "}]
