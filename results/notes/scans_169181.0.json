[{"0":" EKG [**2180-1-3**]: NSR at 74.  Normal axis.  1st degree AV conduction delay.  Borderline prolonged QRS.  No concerning ST or T wave abnormalities.  EKG:  [**2180-12-18**]: NSR 59\/[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] conduction delay 244 ms, normal axis, loss of anterior R waves, no significant other ST\/T wave abnormalities. . 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2179-4-14**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal for the patient's body size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened, and display somewhat reduced systolic excursion, but frank aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. . CXR (Portable AP) [**2181-1-2**]: Cardiac silhouette appears normal. The mediastinal and hilar silhouette appears normal. The aorta and pulmonary vasculature appear unremarkable. Bilateral lungs appear clear. Multiple degenerative changes of the spine are noted with bridging osteophytes. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.   "}]
