[{"0":" IMAGING:  [**2-5**] CTA CHEST: There are no pulmonary artery filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. Additionally, there are no secondary signs of embolism, including no evidence of right-sided heart strain. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications involve the thoracic aorta, which is tortuous; however, there is no acute aortic pathology identified including no aortic dissection. Atherosclerotic calcifications also involve the coronary arteries. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. Scattered prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to approximately 9 mm in short axis. In the lungs, diffuse bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities are associated with a few more focal small ground glass opacities. A small amount of atelectasis is noted at the right lung base. An endotracheal tube appears appropriately positioned with secretions noted in the distal trachea and bronchi. Although this exam is not tailored to evaluate abdominal organs, limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is performed. A nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. A 6.2 cm exophytic cyst projects anterior from the interpolar region of the right kidney, partially imaged. Fullness of the left renal collecting system is only partially imaged. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 2. Diffuse bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities consistent with a small airways infection or inflammation. Aspiration should also be considered in the setting of airway secretions. 3. Fullness of the left renal collecting system is only partially imaged. Dedicated ultrasound to look for frank hydronephrosis can be performed as clinically indicated.  LUE Venous Ultasound:([**2132-2-20**]) INDICATIONS: 64-year-old woman with asthma and asymmetric left upper extremity edema with PICC line. Question DVT. IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis.  Chest X-ray ([**2132-2-19**]): REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of Dobbhoff tube placement. Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2132-2-17**].  The Dobbhoff tube tip is in proximal stomach. The left PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis seen on the left, and the rest of the lungs are unremarkable. Minimal pleural effusion cannot be excluded, especially on the left. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist  =================== [**2132-2-21**] 05:18AM BLOOD WBC-6.2 RBC-3.51* Hgb-10.7* Hct-31.0* MCV-88 MCH-30.4 MCHC-34.4 RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-223 [**2132-2-20**] 03:59AM BLOOD WBC-9.3 RBC-3.48* Hgb-10.5* Hct-30.6* MCV-88 MCH-30.3 MCHC-34.5 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-212 [**2132-2-19**] 06:50PM BLOOD Hct-31.0* [**2132-2-19**] 03:37AM BLOOD WBC-10.9 RBC-3.56* Hgb-11.0* Hct-30.9* MCV-87 MCH-31.0 MCHC-35.7* RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-202 [**2132-2-18**] 04:41PM BLOOD Hct-29.9* [**2132-2-18**] 10:19AM BLOOD Hct-29.4* [**2132-2-18**] 03:58AM BLOOD WBC-8.4 RBC-3.54* Hgb-10.7* Hct-31.2* MCV-88 MCH-30.2 MCHC-34.3 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-190 [**2132-2-17**] 11:14AM BLOOD Hct-33.7* [**2132-2-17**] 03:21AM BLOOD WBC-12.1* RBC-3.86* Hgb-11.9* Hct-33.9* MCV-88 MCH-30.8 MCHC-35.1* RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-209 [**2132-2-16**] 04:01AM BLOOD WBC-12.7* RBC-4.17* Hgb-12.5* Hct-37.0* MCV-89 MCH-29.9 MCHC-33.7 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-218 [**2132-2-15**] 04:37AM BLOOD WBC-15.4* RBC-3.82* Hgb-11.6* Hct-34.2* MCV-90 MCH-30.5 MCHC-34.1 RDW-14.2 Plt Ct-206 [**2132-2-14**] 03:27AM BLOOD WBC-15.6* RBC-3.50* Hgb-10.8* Hct-31.5* MCV-90 MCH-30.8 MCHC-34.3 RDW-14.0 Plt Ct-226 [**2132-2-13**] 03:51AM BLOOD WBC-12.6* RBC-3.55* Hgb-10.9* Hct-32.3* MCV-91 MCH-30.7 MCHC-33.7 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-229 [**2132-2-12**] 03:19AM BLOOD WBC-10.7 RBC-3.33* Hgb-10.6* Hct-30.7* MCV-92 MCH-31.9 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.7 Plt Ct-235 [**2132-2-11**] 03:29AM BLOOD WBC-9.7 RBC-3.28* Hgb-10.5* Hct-30.4* MCV-93 MCH-32.0 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.9 Plt Ct-228 [**2132-2-10**] 03:44AM BLOOD WBC-8.9 RBC-3.43* Hgb-10.7* Hct-31.3* MCV-91 MCH-31.2 MCHC-34.2 RDW-14.1 Plt Ct-203 [**2132-2-9**] 04:24AM BLOOD WBC-10.8 RBC-3.76* Hgb-11.4* Hct-34.0* MCV-90 MCH-30.3 MCHC-33.6 RDW-14.3 Plt Ct-197 [**2132-2-8**] 04:10AM BLOOD WBC-9.5 RBC-3.90* Hgb-11.8* Hct-35.1* MCV-90 MCH-30.4 MCHC-33.7 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-200 [**2132-2-7**] 05:46AM BLOOD WBC-10.3 RBC-4.20* Hgb-13.1* Hct-37.5* MCV-89 MCH-31.2 MCHC-35.0 RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-234 [**2132-2-21**] 05:18AM BLOOD Glucose-114* UreaN-15 Creat-0.6 Na-146* K-3.5 Cl-113* HCO3-24 AnGap-13 [**2132-2-20**] 03:59AM BLOOD Glucose-102 UreaN-14 Creat-0.7 Na-144 K-3.3 Cl-111* HCO3-26 AnGap-10 [**2132-2-19**] 03:37AM BLOOD Glucose-106* UreaN-17 Creat-0.6 Na-145 K-3.5 Cl-112* HCO3-24 AnGap-13 [**2132-2-18**] 03:58AM BLOOD Glucose-116* UreaN-20 Creat-0.6 Na-148* K-3.4 Cl-113* HCO3-25 AnGap-13 [**2132-2-17**] 03:21AM BLOOD Glucose-95 UreaN-22* Creat-0.7 Na-144 K-3.3 Cl-106 HCO3-27 AnGap-14 [**2132-2-16**] 04:01AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-25* Creat-0.6 Na-142 K-3.7 Cl-101 HCO3-31 AnGap-14 [**2132-2-15**] 04:37AM BLOOD Glucose-103 UreaN-25* Creat-0.6 Na-141 K-3.2* Cl-93* HCO3-40* AnGap-11 [**2132-2-5**] 09:35PM BLOOD Glucose-144* UreaN-14 Creat-0.8 Na-140 K-4.6 Cl-101 HCO3-34* AnGap-10 [**2132-2-10**] 03:44AM BLOOD LD(LDH)-195 [**2132-2-6**] 03:33PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-119 [**2132-2-6**] 05:29AM BLOOD CK(CPK)-186* [**2132-2-5**] 09:35PM BLOOD CK(CPK)-250* [**2132-2-6**] 03:33PM BLOOD CK-MB-7 cTropnT-0.04* [**2132-2-6**] 05:29AM BLOOD CK-MB-9 cTropnT-0.06* [**2132-2-5**] 09:35PM BLOOD cTropnT-0.16* [**2132-2-5**] 09:35PM BLOOD CK-MB-10 MB Indx-4.0 [**2132-2-21**] 05:18AM BLOOD Calcium-8.3* Phos-2.6* Mg-2.1 [**2132-2-20**] 03:59AM BLOOD Calcium-7.9* Phos-2.8 Mg-2.1 [**2132-2-19**] 03:37AM BLOOD Calcium-7.7* Phos-2.6* Mg-2.1 [**2132-2-19**] 03:37AM BLOOD Triglyc-100 [**2132-2-13**] 03:51AM BLOOD Triglyc-108 [**2132-2-8**] 04:10AM BLOOD Triglyc-157* [**2132-2-15**] 04:37AM BLOOD Theophy-<0.8*  =======  MICROBIOLOGY:  [**2132-2-10**] 4:33 pm Mini-BAL      BRONCHIAL LAVAGE-MINI TEST..
