[{"0":" In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 62766**] is a 44 year old female admitted initially to an OSH for multifocal pneumonia, found to have an NSTEMI, s\/p BMS to RCA on admission.  Hospital course further complicated by multiorgan system failure. . NSTEMI.  Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to NSTEMI.  Found to have mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior\/inferolateral akinesis on echo.  She had cardiac cath and was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented x2 with BMS.  She was started on aspirin, atorvastatin, and plavix. The patient remained hypotensive after cardiac catheterization, and was found to have mitral regurgitation. Her mitral regurgitation worsened thoughout her hospital course and she developed cardiogenic shock dependent on dobutamine. Her dobutamine was weaned off over several weeks, but she was unable to tolerate hemodialysis while off dobutamine. . Respiratory failure.  Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] after presenting with a multifocal pneumonia.  Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had daily fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and negative cultures.  Her CXR improved, however, she had persistent altered mental status and tachypnea thought be secondary to a central process preventing extubation.  She was given steroids for a short period.  However, given her persistent respiratory alkalosis and cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing, she underwent tracheostomy.  Due to her distorted anatomy secondary to gastric bypass, a PEG was not performed at the same time.  During her hospital course, she had episodes of small amounts of hemoptysis. The patient eventually progressed to being weaned off the vent entirely, and was breathing comfortably on the trach mask. . Altered mental status.  Following cardiac catheterization, patient found to have several embolic strokes.  Patient had serial TTEs and a TEE looking for a source, but was not found. She remained minimally responsive and with cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing.  EEG x 2 showed toxic-metabolic patterns.  Patient was ultimately started on dialysis in hopes that improvemento her uremia might improve her mental status.  Over time, her mental status improved, and she began to follow commands. . Renal Failure.  Patient developed renal failure during her hospital course.  Etiology of her renal failure was not clear. A renal biopsy could not rule out thrombotic microangiopathy, but was felt to be consistent with ATN.  She was started on dialysis.  There was concern for TTP given thrombocytopenia that developed three weeks into her hospital stay, but the decision was made against empiric plasmapharesis after consultation with transfusion medicine.  Patient was given 2 units of cryoprecipitate for increasing DIC picture, and also started on heparin gtt without bolus for concern of TTP and increasing ischemia in lower extremities. She was dialyzed with CVVH, then hemodialysis.  The patient progressed with hemodialysis for several weeks. During the week of [**9-18**] she became intolerant to fluid shifts during hemodialysis and would become hypotensive either during or shortly after hemodialysis.  She was reaching the point where she was requiring fluid boluses after every hemodialysis session. On [**9-20**], she was restarted on CVVH. . DIC\/TMA.  Patient developed thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin split products, low fibrinogen, thought to be consistent with DIC.  She had a biopsy of her skin consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. She had decreased perfusion to her feet as well.  This was felt to be due to DIC in adition to levophed. She was transfused cryoprecipitate and other blood products as needed. Her coagulopathy was treated with IV heparin. Her thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities resolved, however, the patient suffered ischemia of her distal extremities with resulting necrosis.  The patient was left with stable dry gangrene of her left foot up to her ankle, her toes of her right foot, and several fingers on each hand. Vascular surgery was consulted and they recomended pursuing ampuation of her feet after the patient regained better functioning status after a stay at rehab. . Fevers.  Patient initially presenting with daily fevers.  She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics but continued to have daily fevers.  Given yeast in multiple sites (lung, urine),  but never in blood, patient was started on caspofungin.  She was also given steroids for bronchospasm.  In spite of broad spectrum antiobiotics and steroids, she had daily fevers.  Her fevers resolved after discontinuation of steroids and antibiotics.  She subsequently developed a line infection treated with seven days of vancomycin.  The patient develped numerous other infections during her stay.  She developed C.Difficile colitis and was treated with flagyl and oral vancomycin.  She developed a CMV viremia and was treated with ganciclovir.  She had an acitenobacter vent associated pneumonia and completed a course of augmentin.  In addition, she developed multiple other fevers which were attributed to line infetions, treated with vancomycin.  Her central lines were changed by interventional radiology on multiple occasions. . Rhabdo.  Patient developed rhabdo during her hospital stay.  CK reached levels greater than 10,000.  This was thought to be due to decreased mobility secondary to her altered mental status. Her CK trended down to normal levels. . Pain Control: The patient experienced continuous pain from her necrosed and gangrenous feet and fingers. She was treated with IV fentanyl to treat her pain. The family raised concerns that fentanyl administration was causing increased drowsiness of the patient, and requested that it be curtailed. The patient's pain was continuously evaluated by the nursing staff and physicians and treated appropriately with fentanyl. The patient was eventually transitioned to a fentanyl patch with the idea of weaning off her IV fentanyl administration.  Despite the fentanyl patch she was still requiring additional IV fentanyl. . Shock. The patient developed shock on [**7-27**] and remained in shock for the majority of her hospitalization. Initially attributed to septic etiology; she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and placed on neosinephrine, vasopressin, and levophed.  Her neosinephrine and vasopressin was discontinued and she eventually remaned on levophed for blood pressure support. On [**9-1**], TTE findings of 4+ MR, plus low central venous O2 saturations rasied the concern for a cardiogenic componenet. Her levophed was discontinued and dobutamine was begun. Her blood pressure, lactate levels, and central venous O2 saturations improved with initiation of dobutamine.  She remained in cardiogenic shock, dependent on dobutamine until [**9-18**].  Her dobutamine was weaned off and she was able to maintain a mean arterial pressure over 60.  She continued with periods of hypotension, most notable during or immediately after hemodialysis, and required fluid suport during these periods. After one such hypotensive episode [**9-20**] she was not responsive to fluids and was restarted on levophed. her CVVH was restarted on [**9-20**].  The afternoon of [**9-21**] @4pm her routine ABG showed a pH of 6.87, a bicarbonate of 4, and a lactate of 12.9. These results came as a surprise as an ABG at noon [**9-21**] showed a pH of 7.33, with a bicarbonate of 16, and a lactate of 2.0. She remained otherwise hemodynamically stable during this period without alterations in her baseline blood pressure or heart rate.  Her CVVH fluid was immediately changed to provide the maximum amount of bicarbonate.    She slowly became hypotensive and was started on vasopressin, in addition to levophed. She was bolused with a total of 15 amps of sodium bicarbonate over the next 10 hours, in addition to tromethamine which is a bicarbonate alternative. ABGs showed her pH slowly improving to 7.1, with bicarbonate levels improving to 9, however her lactate continued to rise to a peak of 20.9.  The cause of her acte lactic acidois and electrolyte abnormaities were unknown, but it was thought that she may be in worsening cardiogenic shock from a new myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolism, she may have been in septic shock, or she have suffered an insult to another organ system such as acute bowel ischemia. Stat cardiac echo did not show cardiac tamponade, or new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes were trended and were flat.  She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem to cover for possible infection causing shock, in addition to coverage for clostridial species with flagyl, PO vancomycin, and clindamycin.  Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen.  Liver enzymes showed elevated transaminases consistent with ishemic liver, normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, normal lipase, but an elevated amylase to 853.  The acuity of the patient's deterioration, in addition to rising lactate, elevated amylase, and distended abdomen, led us to believe that the patient was experiencing bowel ischemia. this would not be surprising in a patient with an underlying coagulopathy of uncertain etiology.  The family was spoken to at 9pm and told of her grave prognosis. The family was fixated on the patient's fentanyl use, and believed that her depressed mental status was due to fentanyl.  It was explained to her family that her current condition was not secondary to fentanyl administration, and that an acute unidentified event occured which is causing the patient's deterioration. They were told that this event was most likely mesenteric ischemia but that it was uncertain, because the patient was too ill to be imaged. At 4am the patient PEA arrested. CPR was initiated for 90 seconds.  She was given epinephrine and atropine, and begun on neosinephrine and dopamine.  Her blood pressure increased and her pulse returned.  Her sister [**Name (NI) **] was called and told of the events.  She was told that the cause of her impaired cardiac contractility was her underlying acidosis, and that nothing medically could be done to stop the acidosis from worsening. [**Doctor First Name **] requested the patient remain full code.  The patient progressed to apnea and was placed on the ventilator.  She underwent a second PEA arrest at 5am, progressing to torsades de pointes.  She was defibrillated once with return to her junctional rhythm.  She underwent another round of CPR lasting 90 seconds. She was given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate and her blood pressure returned.  her sister [**Name (NI) **] was notified once again after this second PEA arrest.  again, she was told of her grave prognosis, and that her acidosis could not be alleviated.  She again requested that the patient remain full code.  She requested the patient remain full code so that she could contact family members, and have them arrive to the hospital so they could see the paitient while she was still alive.  From the hours of 6am through 8:30am the patient was given epinephrine, atropine, and sodium bicarbonate in order to stabilize her blood pressure.  The patient's hematocrit dring this time decreased from 18.0 to 9.0, possibly from intrabdominal hemorrhage from perforated bowel as a result of bowel ischemia. At 8:30 am the patient's extended family had arrived.  After they had a chance to see the patient alive they requested she be made DNR.  All resuscitative efforts ceased and the patient passed away at 9am.  The following day the family requested an autopsy be performed.  "}]
