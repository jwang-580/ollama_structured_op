[{"0":" 65 year old gentleman with HIV on HARRT (CD4 392 and neg VR in [**2126-6-9**]), hep C, CHF (EF50%) DM and ESRD on HD brought in from [**Hospital3 105**] with positive blood cultures with actinobacter.  . # Septic Shock:  The patient was initially admitted to the floor, however became acutely hypotensive overnight.  He was then transferred to the MICU.  He then required blood pressure support, ultimately requiring triple pressor therapy.  The cause of his hypotension was likely secondary to septic shock from acinetobacter bacteremia diagnosed at [**Hospital1 **].  No subsequent blood cultures were positive.  The patient was started on unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and vancomycin was added to cover MRSA (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc with a history of VISA).  Surveillance blood cultures were sent.  The patient continued to increase the amount of pressors required to maintain adequate MAPs.  Ultimately, the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy decided to withdraw pressor support and make the patient [**Hospital 3225**]. . # Respiratory failure:   Initially his O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the floor.  He had very altered mental status in addition thus was intubated for airway protection.  He did not develop obvious infiltrates on subsequent CXRs.  His psychotropic drugs, gabapentin and narcotics, were held.  He was continued on celexa.  When the HCP decided to make the patient [**Name (NI) 3225**], ventilatory support was withdrawn.  Within 30 min the patient underwent respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest. . # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Continued flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.  Sent surveillance Cdiff cultures . # SBO: Surgery was consulted.  Thought to have had possible ileus or abscess.  OG tube was placed and drained feculent material.  The patient was kept NPO. . # History of graft thrombosis:  Multiple clots in grafts and IVC in past. Goal INR [**2-11**]. . # HIV:  Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**]. Continued outpatient HAART regimen of Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, Ritonavir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate 800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS. . # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU\/mL. Unclear synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) **] was 2.5. INR 3.1 which was presumably from anticoagulation. MRI of abdomen showed hemosiderosis of liver. . # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which was global and likely from either etoh or cocaine. . # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART. Appeared to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 1096**]. Also ESRD on HD so likley this was a contributor. HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**]. . # DM: continued sliding scale insulin . # HTN: continued nifedipine and metoprolol . # ESRD: on HD.  Decided not to start CVVH. . # L3 compression deformity: chronic . # FEN: maintained NPO # PPX: PPI and anticoagulated # CODE: made the patient DNR and [**Month\/Day (4) 3225**] confirmed w\/ HCP fiance-[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 95042**] and his brothers-[**Telephone\/Fax (1) 95043**]  "}]
