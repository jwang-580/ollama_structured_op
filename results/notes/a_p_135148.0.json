[{"0":" 74 year old F with ESRD on dialyis, CAD s\/p CABG, COPD, HIT+ on coumadin, chronically ventilated, trach\/PEG who is transfered from [**Hospital1 **] for dialysis catheter replacement. . # HD line change: Pt was transferred for intermittently working HD line. On CXR, line appeared short, which may be contributing to mechanical difficulties. There was also some thought that patient may have a persistant SVC also contributing to line difficulties. IR guided change of line was performed after INR was reversed with FFP. She was restarted on coumadin at discharge. INR was 2.2 on day of discharge, her goal was [**2-1**]. . # ESRD on HD: Per pt's daughter, she had some mild CRI of unknown etiology prior to recent hospitalizations, followed by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] became HD dependent after recent prolongued hospitalization. She received 1 HD session with 2kg removal. She did received 4000 units Epo with HD on [**2135-4-20**]. On day of discharge, [**4-21**], she underwent another HD session and the new HD line was working very well. . # Respiratory Failure:  She remained on the Vent without issues. Of note, meropenam was stopped as [**Hospital1 **] note stated that she should have 10 day course and first dose received on [**2135-4-6**] (last should be [**4-16**]). Flagyl was continued as per [**Hospital1 **] records. The need for continued Flagyl should be re-addressed at [**Hospital1 **], as this can likely be stopped as well if it was also started for aspiration pneumonia. . # PICC line placement: Pt arrived with RIJ. After discussion with family, family was amenable to switching to single lumen PICC. As she has stopped her IV meropenam, she may not have long-term needs for PICC line and we recommend that this be removed in favor of peripheral IV once needs for IV antibiotics are clarified. . # COPD:  She continued spiriva and nebs. Her predinsone 15 mg daily was continued. It was unclear how long her taper was supposed to be. We recommend follow-up regarding duration of prednisone taper and if she will be chronically on higher steroid doses, she may benefit from ppx with bactrim. . # HTN:  She continued clonidine, labetalol, isordil, lisinopril  . # Gastroparesis: continued reglan . # Depression\/Anxiety:  continued paxil and seroquel . # Prophylaxis: PPI, therapeutic INR, bowel regimen . # Code Status: Full  "}]
