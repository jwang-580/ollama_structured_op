[{"0":" Pt is a 30 yo male s\/p cardiac arrest in the setting of suspected heroin overdose. Reported downtime of ~10min in the field f\/b 30min of CPR before restoration of vital signs. Admitted to the Medical ICU for Artic Sun post-arrest induced mild hypothermia protocol.  #Anoxic brain injury - Minimal neurologic response prior to initiation of cooling protocol. 24hr protocol completed and rewarming initiated. During rewarming, he developed profound rigors and subsequently became febrile to 104. The rigors were not responsive to increasing sedation or demerol, thus he was re-paralyzed. The following morning, the paralytic was discontinued, and he developed movements more consistent with seizure activity most prominent in the R arm and R leg.  He was loaded with phenytoin with some improvement in seizure activity and neurology was consulted. He developed persistent breakthrough seizure-like movements requiring boluses of phenytoin and initiation of Keppra.  A video EEG was performed and results showed diffuse encephalopathic changes without evidence of electrographic seizures. An MRI was performed on [**2145-10-6**] which revealed findings c\/w global infaraction, anoxic brain injury, and diffuse cerebal edema. On the morning of [**2145-10-7**], pt was noted to have a change in his pupillary exam and papilledema. A STAT head CT revealed complete loss of grey-white matter differentiation c\/w diffuse cerebral edema. Pt was started on mannitol infusion, HOB to 30 degrees, and hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 28.  Neurosurgery was consulted, placed a bolt, found the initial ICP to be 24. Pt was continued on mannitol q6h, Keppra, and continous ICP monitoring (ICPs ranged from 20s-60s). Neurologic exams off-sedation revealed absent corneal reflexes, absent cold calorics, and no response to painful stimuli. Apnea tests x 2 ([**10-11**], [**10-13**]) revealed that patient continued to demonstrate respiratory effort, and thus did not meet criteria for brain death. After ongoing discussions with the family regarding his poor prognosis, and based on previously expressed wishes of the patient, the family decided to shift goals of care to CMO on the morning of [**2145-10-14**]. He was extubated, made comfortable with morphine, and declared dead at 1:39pm on [**2145-10-14**]. NEOB had been contact[**Name (NI) **] and pt was ruled out for donation after cardiac death.  # S\/p Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Pt received the 24hr post-arrest hypothermia protocol. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative for any significant ischemia. A transthoracic ECHO done on [**2145-10-5**] revelead normal structure and function. Pt remained hemodynamically stable without need for vasopressor support.  #Fever: Pt became febrile in the midst of diffuse rigors. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were sent. A CXR on [**2145-10-6**] revealed a new LLL opacity, consistent with atelectasis vs. infiltrate. He was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to cover for possible aspiration. He was switched to Ceftriaxone and Flagyl the following morning (concern for lowering the seizure threshold on flouroquinolones). Blood and urine cultures were negative but sputum cultures were positive for Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Staph Aureus. Bronchoscopy on [**2145-10-20**] revealed copious purulent secretions. Pt was treated with appropriate IV antibiotics until the decision made made to focus on CMO.  The family was provided with support from social work and the hospital priest & chaplaincy services. They were at the bedside when he expired.   "}]
