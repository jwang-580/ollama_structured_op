Sputum Cx: contaminated with oropharyngeal secretions x2. Urine Cx: negative final Respiratory cultures: DFA negative Blood Cx: NGTD . STUDIES: CXR: Bibasilar airspace opacities worrisome for infection or aspiration. Unchanged large superior mediastinal mass. . EKG: NSR at 77, slightly leftward axis, left atrial enlargement, partial RBBB, lateral concave <1mm ST elevations c\/w early repolarization - pt symptomatic.  [**2140-12-9**]: AP chest compared to [**12-8**]: Lateral aspect of the left lower chest and the extreme lung apices are excluded from the examination. Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the distal stomach but the tip is indistinct. Stomach has been decompressed. Intestinal distention noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen. Right basal atelectasis stable. More severe opacification at the left lung base also probably atelectasis grossly unchanged but incompletely imaged. Pleural effusions are small if any. Upper lungs clear. Heart size normal. Upper mediastinal mass stable.  CT chest: 0\/28\/09: IMPRESSION: 1. Slightly increased size of posterior mediastinal mass with stable appearance to satellite lesions including a nodule in the lingula. 2. Increased size of now moderate pleural effusions with associated relaxation atelectasis. 3. Essentially stable appearance to renal cysts.   "}]
