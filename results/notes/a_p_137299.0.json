[{"0":" Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the intensive care unit for evaluation\/treatment of GI bleed.  NG lavage was performed and clear.  He received a total of 4 units of pRBCs (2 on [**3-30**] and 2 on [**4-3**]) with stable hematocrit and no further episodes of melena. He was treated with a Protonix drip, transitioned to IV bid. The GI team was consulted, and there was some concern that he might need to be intubated for the procedure given his history of interstitial lung disease (complicated by recent ARDS at OSH and high O2 requirement). Ultimately, the patient and his HCP decided against an endoscopy with or without intubation. Plavix and aspirin were held given bleeding, and GI felt that he would be at high risk for rebleed with Plavix given no definitive intervention was done.  His need for Plavix was discussed with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he was determined to no longer need this medication.  He was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge and transitioned to twice daily oral PPI.  He will be on this medication for two months and then can transition to once daily.  Hypoxia\/IPF\/COPD: The patient's hypoxia was likely multifactorial and was thought to be due to ARDS in addition to his COPD and IPF. The patient's steroid taper had finished on [**4-4**] (after 5 days of prednisone 5 mg po daily). His oxygen saturations improved with diuresis although he continued to require several liters of supplemental oxygen.  His nebulizers were continued.  Hx of CAD s\/p PCI: He did not have any chest pain or discomfort during the admission.  His metoprolol and simvastatin were continued but his plavix and aspirin were initially held in the setting of his GI bleed.  As mentioned above, his plavix was completely stopped but he was restarted on 81mg of aspirin daily prior to discharge.  Loose stool: Noted to have some loose stools on the day of discharge, without melena or hematochezia. Did not test for C diff, but GI advised testing for C diff if diarrhea continued.  Diabetes type II: He is on metformin and januvia as an outpatient, but these had been held in the setting of variable po intake.  While in the hospital, he was treated with sliding scale insulin.  Herpes Zoster: Patient has an outbreak of herpes zoster on his buttocks.  Upon review of his [**Hospital1 100**] records, he appears to have started acyclovir treatment on [**3-25**], and this was stopped on [**4-6**].  Hypertension: He was continued on metoprolol.  Hx of multifocal atrial tachycardia: He was in sinus rhythm during the admission and continued on metoprolol.  Depression: His home sertraline was continued.  Nutrition: He was seen by speech and swallow and advised to have 1:1 supervision with feeds but can have regular diet with thin liquids and meds whole with apple sauce.  Code status: DNR\/DNI, confirmed with HCP  "}]
