MICROBIOLOGY: [**2148-2-24**] Blood Cx - negative [**2148-2-24**] Urine cx - Pseudomonas pan sensitive [**2148-2-25**] Sputum Cx - staph aureus (sparse growth) and yeast [**2148-2-25**] Urine legionella - negative . STUDIES: [**2148-2-24**] CXR Focal opacity at the right heart border in the right lower lung may represent focal pneumonia (favored) or atelectasis.  [**2148-2-24**] CTA Chest 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 2. Improved bibasilar atelectasis and left lung ground-glass opacities. These chronic atelectatic findings may be secondary to chest wall deformities and poor inspiratory efforts in the setting of multiple chronic rib fractures. 3. Mucoid impaction in bilateral lower lobe bronchioles.  [**2148-2-27**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-24**]:   Extensive opacification has developed in the perihilar regions of both lungs, accompanied by a new small right pleural effusion most consistent with pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation. Tip of the left PIC line extends approximately a centimeter beyond the wire, in the mid-to-upper SVC.  No pneumothorax. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and venous access nurse were both paged   "}]
