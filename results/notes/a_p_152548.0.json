[{"0":" This is a  44 year-old male with a history of hemochromatosis, cirrhotic liver disease, and known grade 4 esophageal varices (diagnosed in [**2122**]), who presents with hematemesis.  In the OSH, EGD was performed revealing active bleeding.  Since banding was performed, the patient has remained hemodynamically stable, with one episode of coffee-ground emesis (likely from residual blood in the stomach), but no further bright red blood.  In this patient alcoholic liver damage and damage from iron deposition both contribute to liver disease and esophageal varices (via the effect on portal pressures).  The plan for management should include risk reduction for further variceal bleeds, and should also include social work\/ counceling for cessation of alcohol intake. . # Hematemasis: [**2-19**] grade 4 variceal bleeding on OSH EGD, s\/p banding, was not HD stable at OSH but BP has improved to SBP 98-105, MAP 70. Hcts and HD stable here. Continued on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], Octreotide gtt, and Cipro IV for SBP prophylaxis. Hepatology consult team was following, who felt that another EGD would not be needed urgently but should be done soon as an outpatient. He was restarted on low-dose PO nadolol once tolerating a clear liquid diet and was advanced to a regular diet before transfer to the floor.  He tolerated PO well and was discharged on half his dose of nadolol given pressures in the high 90-100 range. He will have his HCT checked at his PCP or Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office in 1 week, will f\/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in 2 weeks, and will have a repeat EGD at that time. . # Cirrhosis: MELD 18-> 23. No evidence of acute hepatitis but Cr, INR and T.bili are elevated. He was continued on lactulose and vitamins, but his spironolactone was held in the setting of the variceal bleeding and restarted on day of discharge. . # DM, type 1: high blood sugars but no gap, FS on admission here 370's. He reportedly is non-compliant with diabetic diet and insulin for blood sugar control. He was continued on his home dose of lantus and monitored with a sliding scale. He was also continued on gabapentin and PRN ultram for his neuropathy once taking POs. . # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.7, 1.1 at OSH, likely secondary to hypotension and recent poor intake; already received fluids and 2 units pRBC's. Stable. . # Depression: Citalopram restarted once taking POs.  "}]
