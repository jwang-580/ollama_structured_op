[{"0":" ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 83-yo woman w\/ chronic dCHF (LVH, EF 75%), chronic A-fib on anticoagulation, severe pulm HTN, DM, HTN, HL, and metastatic thyroid Ca s\/p CyberKnife therapy, p\/w 20-pound weight gain x2 weeks and progressively worsening SOB and DOE, found to be in A-fib w\/ RVR in the ED, hypotensive, and hypoxic, admitted to the CCU, improved w diuresis and transferred temporarily to regular floor. Readmitted to CCU for hypercarbic respiratory failure improved on BiPaP.   Diltiazem had been used for rate control - beta blockers were discontinued given concern for ?contribution to respiratory decompensation on the floor. She was empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible HAP on [**12-20**].  She was transfered to the MICU at the request of the patient's family. . # Hypercarbic\/hypoxemic respiratory failure: Multiple potential etiologies, in part secondary to her hypervolemia as well as known pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Pulmonary consult was following the patient, then the patient was transfered to the MICU.  Considered tapping pleural effusions, but determined to be technically difficult as the patient had elevated INR.  The patient was aggressively diuresed with lasix drip.  The patient was continued on BiPAP and was able to be weaned to NC only.  Neurology was consulted, paradoxical breathing could be result of myopathy.  However, the patient decided after much discussion that she desired to have comfort measures only.  The patient was made comfortable, underwent respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest in minutes following. . #. PUMP: Pt w\/ known chronic dCHF (LVH and EF 75%), p\/w acute exacerbation in the setting of afib with RVR.  She was overloaded on exam and was responsive to a lasix drip with improvement in volume status. TTE showed EF 70-75%, markedly dilated RV w\/ moderate global HK, preserved LV regional and global systolic function, severe diastolic dysfunction, moderate to severe pulmonary hypertenion.  Given hypotension and mild acute renal failure, lasix drip was continued with 1-1.5 L net diuresis daily.  Spironolactone was also continued at home dose.  With improvement in her volume status, she was transferred to the regular floor, however, readmitted to CCU for hypercarbic\/hypoxemic respiratory failure. Pt i\/o slightly net negative, but unable to adequately diurese secondary to hypotension.  Nonetheless, the patient appears volume overloaded, restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Continued lasix gtt, then switched to bolus lasix. . # RHYTHM: Pt was noted to have chronic atrial fibrillation, no previous attempts at cardioversion.  She was in a-Fib w\/ RVR on presentation to ED, w\/ hypotension as below, in setting of worsening symptoms since stopping Digoxin and uptitrating Toprol XL.  Low TSH also suggested a contribution of thyrotoxicity secondary to CyberKnife therapy for thyroid cancer.   She was started on Esmolol gtt which was titrated to max in ED. Also given IV Digoxin 250mg x 2 in ED.  Upon arrival to CCU, Diltiazem bolus + gtt were started with good effect, and esmolol was titrated off.  No more digoxin was given.   Rate was subsequently well controlled on PO and diltiazem, which were increased for goal HR <80.  Coumadin was continued but INR became supratherapeutic.  Now s\/p diltiazem and esmolol drips on PO diltiazem and metoprolol with HR 90-100.  Low TSH suggests probable contribution from thyrotoxicity likely from CyberKnife therapy to thyroid cancer.   Due to supratherapeutic INR, coumadin was d\/c'd. . # CORONARIES: No known CAD, but w\/ many risk factors. . # HYPOTENSION: Pt w\/ SBP 80s-90s in ED in the setting of RVR, and neosynephrine  was started for BP support while on rate-controlling agents.  She continued to mentate well even though hypotensive.  She was briefly febrile, but no infection was identified and sepsis was considered unlikely.  Random cortisol was high, ruling out adrenal insufficiency as a cause. Hypotension was attributed to  poor forward flow from acute on chronic diastolic CHF and A-Fib\/RVR.  Blood pressure improved with rate control and diuresis. Now low normal BP with fluctuating mentation. Low UOP on lasix drip, ultrafiltration was considered. . # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely [**1-15**] poor forward flow from A-Fib\/RVR. Will likely improve with HR control and diuresis. Urine lytes c\/w prerenal physiology. Renal following. . # DIABETES: On oral meds at home for glycemic control. ISS while inpatient. . # CROHN'S DISEASE: continued home Pentasa, PPI. . # SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Pt on coumadin for a-fib, but INR now > 6, unclear etiology. . # ETHICS: Pt was DNR\/DNI, but family says pt confused. Patient says \"I want to die\" but son wants full code. Had family meeting with PCP and endocrinology. Ethics following.  She has a tortuous trachea - ENT has eval'd think intubation would not be problem[**Name (NI) 115**]. Family meetings- pt to remain full code for now and aggrees to trial intubation if needed. Pt eventually CMO.   "}]
