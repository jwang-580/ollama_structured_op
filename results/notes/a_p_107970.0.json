[{"0":" 31 y\/o with gestational hypertension, admitted to L+D for induction of labor. She was given Cytotec, and progressed adequately and started on Pitocin. Notably, she had several elevated BPs during her labor course, to 171\/101. During her labor course, FHT revealed variable decelerations with late components, followed by a fetal bradycardia for 3 minutes. She was taken for stat cesarean section, which was  complicated by atonic uterus. A D+C was done, as well as an attempt to place B-[**Doctor Last Name **] sutures, and ultimately hysterectomy was performed - see operative notes. The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] initially, and once extubated and stable, returned to the post-partum floor. Issues during hospitalization were as follows: . 1. Vaginal bleeding: Felt to be secondary to atonic uterus. Perioperative labs were notable for new coagulopathy and decreasing fibrinogen, concerning for DIC. Estimated intra-op blood loss was 4 L. Received 7 units pRBC, 4 units of FFP and 1 bag platelets.  On POD #1, she was hemodynamically stable, with elevated blood pressures off neosynephrine, extubated to room air, normal coags, platelets increased to 90s, and stable HCT around 23. Pt was called out to OB service and transferred to the postpartum floor. She remained hemodynamically stable on the floor through discharge. . 2. Intubation: Given vecuronium during procedure, felt to last another ~ 2 hours so patient was intubated overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but then extubated without any complications in the morning. She was breathing comfortably on room air upon transfer and continued to have no issues related to this during her post-operative recovery. . 3. Metabolic acidosis: With elevated lactate, full chem panel not available but likely with elevated AG.  Also likely a component of non-gap acidosis in setting of volume resuscitation.  Upon transfer, gap had closed, and lactate was down to 1.8. She remained stable in this regard. . 4. Elevated blood pressures: thought to be a due to her gestational hypertension. She was started on Labetalol 300 [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-31**] for systolic BP of 160, and discharged on this medication. PIH labs remained unremarkable.   "}]
