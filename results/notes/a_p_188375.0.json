[{"0":" 49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. . Respiratory failure: Transferred from floor to ICU for combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Etiology unclear but likely a combination of chronic lung disease and mild CHF. Chronically elevated Hct suggested chronic hypoxia, likely due to a combination of COPD and OSA. pH of 7.3 with pCO2 of 82 suggests chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. BL pCO2 likely ~ 70. No obvious infection on CXR to suggest pna. Increased LE edema and elevated BNP raised possibility of CHF. He ruled out for acute MI and TTE was limited but LV function was thought to be normal with mild RV dilation and hypokinesis. He initially required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation which was weaned off on hospital day #2. He was treated for COPD exacerbation with IV solumedrol which was transitioned to oral prednisone on hospital day # 3. He received levofloxacin for possible atypical pneumonia for a 5 day course. He was continued on his home Advair and received albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. He diuresed well with IV lasix.  He remained relatively hypoxic requiring 5L via nasal cannula to maintain O2 sats in the 90s and required noninvasive mechanical ventilation overnight to maintain oxygenation. Both bipap and noninvasive cpap were used during his stay however the patient could not tolerate bipap despite trying on different masks. He preferred to stay on O2 NC which at 5L maintained O2 saturations from mid 80s to low 90s. It was felt the patient would benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation and at the patient's preference he was given contact information to schedule this as an outpatient. The patient was newly started on furosemide 10mg daily. He was counselled to weigh himself daily, call his PCP for any weight increase >3lbs and to adhere to a low salt diet. The patient ambulated with PT the day prior to discharge and maintained an oxygen saturation of >90% on oxygen, 4L by NC. . Dizziness\/lightheadedness: Unclear cause. Potentially due to significant hypoxia as was in 70s on RA at outpt appointment on admission. He had no further symptoms throughout his hospitalization. No arrhythmias on telemetry. Symptoms did not recur during his stay. . Erythrocytosis. The patient was found to have profound erythrocytosis to Hct of 60. He was evaluated by the heme-onc consult service who felt this most likely represented secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia. Epo level was sent and is pending at the time of discharge. Due to the marked elevation in Hct, the patient was felt to be at risk for symptoms associated with his condition. He was initiated on phlebotomy and underwent 1U removal with Hct decline to 57. He will follow-up in the hematology clinics for ongoing care of this issue including ongoing phlebotomy with likely goal Hct 55. It is possible though unlikely that the patient will experience hypoxia associated with this loss in oxygen carrying capacity. . Diabetes: well controlled according to most recent HbA1C. On metformin as outpt. Metformin was held during admission and he was controlled with insulin sliding scale. He was restarted on metformin prior to discharge. . Hypertension: Patient was normotensive throughout admission with low normal SBPs in 90s with sleep.  He was continued on his home regimen of lisinopril and metoprolol. . CAD: s\/p IMI in past by report and prior stenting. Large reversible defect in inferior wall in [**3-16**] but no intervenable CAD on cath in [**5-15**]. No chest pain on history and he ruled out for MI with serial enzymes. He was continued on asa, statin, beta blocker, and ace inhibitor. . Diastolic heart failure. As described above, the patient was confirmed on TTE to have diastolic heart failure. He was started on simvastatin for this issue as well his history of CAD. . OSA: As above, required noninvasive mechanical ventilation overnight to maintain oxygenation. . Code: The patient is full code.  "}]
