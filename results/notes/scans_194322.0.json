[{"0":" [**2151-10-25**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a complex 80-90% proximal stenosis, possibly a recanalized total occlusion. D1 branch had a 70% stenosis at its origin. The LCx had an 80-90% stenosis at its origin with an 80% stenosis in OM1. The RCA was totally occluded proximally with left to right collaterals originating from S1 just before the proximal LAD lesion. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left and right sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 20 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with a PASP of 48 mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.4 L\/min\/m2. [**2151-10-25**] Chest CT: 1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation, right greater than left, most likely aspiration pneumonia, alternatively blood aspiration. Extensive bronchial wall thickening reflects marked bronchial inflammation. In the setting of severe emphysema, worsened since [**2146**], pulmonary abnormality is understandably asymmetric and needs to be followed to exclude a small mass, which could be obscured by the current abnormality. 2. Large left ventricular aneurysm grown only slightly since [**2146**]. No pulmonary edema. 3. Tablet in the distal esophagus. [**2151-10-27**] LE vein mapping: On the right greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters of 0.18 -0.33. Left greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters of 0.17-0.69.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium\/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium\/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the infero\/inferolateral basal, mid, distal, and apical walls and hypokinesis of the mid anterior and anteroseptal walls. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are extensive calcifications and complex (>4 mm) atheroma in the aortic root, ascending aorta, arch, and descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. [**2151-11-1**] Carotid U\/S: 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.   "}]
