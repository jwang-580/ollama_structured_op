In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.1, 67, 114\/60, 17, 100%RA. He remained afebrile and he blood pressure and heart rate remained about the same durin ghis ED course. Unasyn was given. Initial lactate was 3.4 and it came down to 1.4 with 1L NS. His abd was noted to be distended and he admitted to some intermittent abdominal pain. CT abd was done that showed dilated small bowels suggestive of SBO. Surgery was called and felt like there is no need for surgery this point. NGT was offered but the patient adamantly refused. Pt reportedly was passing gas. He was then admitted to medicine for further care. . On arrival to the floor, he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abd pain, n\/v\/d.
