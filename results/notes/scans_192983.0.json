The LMCA had 20% lesion. The origin LAD had 20% lesion and serial 30% lesions afterwards. The LCX had 30% serial lesions. The RCA had an anomalous take off (high in the aorta) and was enganed by an AL1 (fter failed engagement with [**Doctor Last Name **] 0.75, [**Female First Name (un) 899**], AR-2, AR-1, JR4). The RCA was very heavily calcified, markedly tortuous, and was a superdominant vessel supplying a large territory with TIMI 2 flow throughout. Serial thrombotic lesions were seen in the RCA (50-90% stenosis) with an active ulcerated lesion in the distal RCA. 2- Limted resting hemodynamic assessment showed mild systemic arterial hypertension (152\/68 mmHg). 3- Successful PTCA of the distal RCA with 3.0x15 mm Voyager balloon inflated to 14 ATM. No reflow followed baloon rupture that resonded to IC NTG. A nonflow-limiting Type A dissection was also noted at the angioplasty site. Final angiography showed less thrombotic burden with serial 50-70% ersidual lesions. TIMI 3 flow was evident. 4- Successful removal of the RCFA and RCFV with adequate hemostasis.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. SUccessful percutaneous thrombectomy and PTCA of the RCA with  inmproved flow (TIMI 3) and less thrombus burden. 3- Successful removal of arterial and venous sheaths. 4- Continue Integrilin for 48 hours 5- ASA and Plavix (dual therapy) for 12 months . ECHO: [**2127-5-17**] Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c\/w CAD. Moderate aortic stenosis.  "}]
