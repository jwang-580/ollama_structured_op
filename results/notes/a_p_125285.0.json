[{"0":" Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old woman with asthma and bronchiectasis who was admitted to the ICU with fevers, cough, myalgias, and SOB x 1 week, concerning for viral infection and exacerbation of underlying asthma, ICU admission due to increased work of breathing, tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirement. Upon arriving to the ICU, her influenza swab returned positive.  # INFLUENZA: As below, she was started on tamiflu and given the severity of her symptoms and her co morbidities, she was continued on tamiflu for 10 days.  # HOSPITAL ACQUIRED PNA: Her clear CXR, symptoms and positive swab confirmed influenza without superimposed bacterial infection (no evidence of consolidation on admission) so antibiotics were not started initially. Tamiflu was started on arrival to ICU and supportive care with tylenol and intravenous fluids was implemented. However, due to increasing leukocytosis, cough productive of yellowish sputum and persistent desaturations despite tamiflu and nebulizer treatment on [**11-25**], CXR was obtained which showed a focal consolidation which was most likely pneumonia. Due to these results, empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime were started for an 8-day course to end [**2194-12-3**]. Sputum culture was sent which revealed two different types of gram-negative rods. Due to her bronchiectasis and previous colonizers (pseudomonas and e.coli are the likely pathogens) which is why ceftazidime was started.  Given that there was no evidence of MRSA growing in the sputum culture, vancomycin was discontinued.  Atypical coverage was not initated due to clinical picture most consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia and initial clear film.   On transfer to the floor, her respiratory status was stable and pt was able to wean off supplemental oxygen.  She received a PICC line on [**11-29**] and was discharged on [**12-1**] to complete her final doses of ceffazidime.  She will need a follow up CXR as an outpatient in [**4-7**] weeks to ensure resolution.  #ASTHMA EXACERBATION Outpatient asthma regimen was maintained. Patient must be sent out on budesonide inhaler without alteration of outpatient asthma regimen. (She cannot tolerated fluticasone). Initially on IV steroids at time of admission on [**11-22**] but switched to PO prednisone taper on [**11-23**]. She completed 5 days of Prednisone at 60mg daily on [**11-27**] and was changed over to 40mg. She will need a slow prednisone taper of 40mg x4 days to 30mg x3days to 20mg x 3 days, then 15mg x 3 days to eventual 10mg\/daily which is her outpatient dose.  # [**Name (NI) **] Pt has no history of diabetes and elevated BG is likely in the setting of elevated prednisone dose.  On discharge, she was on prednisone 30mg daily and requiring approximately 8 units of lantus.  In anticipation of lowering her prednisone dose, her lantus was decreased to 5 units on discharge.  Her niece was given diabetes teaching and was able to administer the medication appropriately.  She was instructed to stop insulin once her prednisone dose was decreased to 15mg daily (given that 10mg is her home dose).  # TACHYCARDIA- Ms. [**Known lastname **] is tachycardic to 100's at baseline from outpatient pulmn notes, and becomes tachycardic to 130s-140s when getting albuterol nebs.  On the floor her HR decreased to 80s, but do increase with albuterol nebulizes.  # Anemia, normocytic, mild Fe deficiency noted [**7-10**].  Her Hct declined to 27 on discharge.  She was guaiac negative and her iron supplement was continued.  She will need continued outpatient monitoring of her hematocrit.  # Chrondrocalcinosis - on prednisone 10 mg as outpt  # HTN, benign - Home medications were continued  # Osteoporosis - ca, vit D, foasamax q week  # CKD stage 3 - stable.s  # elevated PTT - suspected spurious secondary to subcutaneous heparin as admission coags normal.  Repeat coags were wnl off of heparin SQ.   "}]
