This organism may develop resistance to third generation          cephalosporins during prolonged therapy.

GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).     Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2101-5-26**]):    GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S). . [**5-22**] CT ABD\/Pelvis CT ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. The liver, pancreas and gallbladder are unremarkable. The spleen is small. Bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. Within both kidneys, there are areas of wedge-shaped hypoattenuation which may represent scarring or old infarcts. The left kidney demonstrates marked perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement. A small amount of fluid in the left paracolic gutter is also identified. Given these findings, there may be an acute-on- chronic presentation of pyelonephritis on the left. Contrast is seen throughout the course of the ureters with bilateral ureteral jets. No evidence of ureteral calculi. The presence of renal calculi is indeterminate given the IV contrast on board. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  CT OF THE PELVIS: The sigmoid, rectum, bladder and uterus are unremarkable. There is no evidence of diverticulosis or diverticulitis. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free air.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified. A tiny sclerotic focus in the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] likely represents a bone island.  IMPRESSION: 1. Left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic gutter. These findings are concerning for acute pyelonephritis. No definite renal calculi identified, however the presence of IV contrast limits this evaluation. 2. Bilateral wedge-shaped hypoattenuating areas likely suggest old scarring or possibly chronic pyelonephritis. Clinical correlation is recommended  . [**5-22**] CT HEAD FINDINGS: There is no shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are unremarkable. There is normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or fracture. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.  . [**5-24**] CT CHEST FINDINGS: Subtle analysis of the lung parenchyma is compromised by severe motion artifacts related to ventilation. At both lung apices, there is minimal subpleural scarring. Bilaterally, small pleural effusions and subsequent atelectasis in the dependent parts of the lungs are seen. Minimal fluid marking of the interstitium at the bases of the lungs indicates mild interstitial fluid overload. There are no focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia, and no lung masses. In the mediastinum, notably in the para-aortic and retrocaval region, numerically increased but normal to borderline-sized lymph nodes are seen. The size of the heart is slightly increased, there is no pericardial effusion, however, coronary calcifications are seen. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in situ.  IMPRESSION: Extensive motion artifacts caused by ventilation. Subtle fluid overload, subtle bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral atelectasis. No evidence of inflammatory or neoplastic lung disease. Endotracheal and nasogastric tube in situ.   "}]
