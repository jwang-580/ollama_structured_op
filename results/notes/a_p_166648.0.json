[{"0":" 78 yo M with PMH of NSCLC s\/p wedge resection x 2, COPD on home O2, hypertension presents with acute onset SOB and worsening failure to thrive over 3 weeks.  1. SOB: Was thought to be primarily due to acute on chronic diastolic CHF with concominant COPD exacerbation. In the ICU, patient was given BIPAP with good response. Was started on emperic lovenox and abx, these were both discontinued once CTA chest confirmed no PE or no pneumonia. The patient improved significantly with diureses and standing nebs and steroid taper, however, patient eventually plateaud and continued to complain of SOB and wheezing. This was most likely secondary to excess fluid remaining. Patient had a small cardiac enzyme leak, likely demand related during his acute hypoxic and tachypnic episode. Cardiology saw the patient and recommended further diuresis. The patient was diuresed with good response in his symptoms. The patient still has room to go for diuresis (still has 1+ pitting pedal edema), and will need to continue high dose PO Lasix (120mg PO BID) for 7 days until titrated back down to a maintanaince regimen.  2. Hoarse voice\/? Aspiration: Per daughter's report, coughing with food.  S&S was obtained at bedside, which patient passed. Per S&S, if more concern, can attempt a video S&S. Started on regular diet and maintained aspiration precautions. This was not a significant issue.  3. NSCLC: He was receiving carboplatin and gemcitabine for third line palliative chemotherapy with signs of some response. Repeat CT scan did not show significant change in disease progression. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his oncologist, was made aware of pt's admission and will f\/u with him as an outpatient to discuss continuing his chemo regimen.  4. COPD: Noted wheezes and rhonchi on exam on admission. Wheezes persisted on thought to be likely secondary to diastolic CHF. Placed on standing nebulizers and outpatient regimen. Patient was placed on a steroid taper. Pulmonology was consulted and recommended Spiriva, advair, and placing PRN albuterol and ipratropium.  5. HTN: continue ACE and bblocker for afterload reduction. Started Carvedolol for patient's heart failure.  6. Aminitis: Patient had a mild transaminitis, the slightly worsened but remained otherwise stable. Patient denied RUQ pain. Labs were not c\/w obstructive etiology. Labs should be followed up by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] persistently elevated or worsened, may need further work-up. Patient is scheduled to see PCP in [**Month (only) 359**]. Also has just been scheduled for [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital 1944**] clinic to check lytes and adjust lasix dose.  7. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin  8.
