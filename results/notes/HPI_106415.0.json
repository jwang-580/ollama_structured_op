He presented on [**11-12**] with 2 days of worsening dyspnea, cough, and fever\/chills.  Also with orthopnea, PND, and worsening edema in all 4 extremities. . Labs showed ARF with creatinine of 5.8 (up from 2.9).

Patient was in angio having hemodialysis line placed when his arrest event occurred.  He was placed in a lateral decubitus position due to difficulty lying flat due to shortness of breath.  Towards the end of his line placement, he became more agitated and was pushing his facemask away.  O2 sats were unable to be obtained.  He was then placed in supine position for line suturing.  He was then noted to be nonresponsive, code blue call.  Then noted to be pulseless.  CPR initiated and initial rhythm asystole\/very slow PEA, subsequently faster PEA.
