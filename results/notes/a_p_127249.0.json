[{"0":" 64 y\/o gentleman with asthma, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia presents with acute respiratory failure.  # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented with severe asthma exacerbation, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Initially, he required paralysis in order to maintain ventilator synchrony.  He was placed on respiratory precautions while a viral illness was ruled out; a rapid viral screen was negative for influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and RSV infection.  At time of admission, he was started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin as empiric coverage for a community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.  He was treated with high-dose solumedrol and continuous bronchodilatory MDI's in effort to reduce his airway resistance.  A pan-sensitive pseudomonas organism was subsequently cultured from a sputum sample obtained at the time of his presentation.  On [**2-7**], his antibiotic coverage was changed to Levofloxacin and Zosyn for double-coverage of Pseudomonas. His ventilator settings were managed to allow permissive hypercapnea, and remained stable but without improvement.  The differential for the trigger for his asthma exacerbation was broadened, and a mini-BAL was performed on [**2-10**] with sample sent for fungal culture and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 23426**].  LDH was 195, making PCP less likely.  Fungal markers were sent. The pt was eventually extubated and transferred to the floor where he completed his 2 week course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Prior to discharge pt was saturating adequately on 2l nasal canula with Fluticasone, Albuterol, Montelukast, Albuterol inhalers. Pulmonary team were also consulted prior to transfer and recommended a slow Prednisone taper of 1. 40mg Prednisone once a day x 5 days (starting [**2132-2-22**]) 2. 30mg Prednisone once a day x 5 days (starting [**2132-2-27**]) 3. 20mg Prednisone once a day, he should be continued on this dose until he is seen by his outpatient Pulmonary physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23427**] at [**Hospital1 756**], office number: [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 23428**]. Unfortunately Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23427**] was not available at time of discharge to set up appointment, he was e-mailed with details of the pt's discharge and his transition to [**Hospital1 **] for Rehab. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 23429**] clinic he will call the rehab for the appointment needed in 4 weeks time.  # Steroid Prophylaxis: After discussion with Pulmonary prior to discharge pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim as well as Calcium and Vitamin D.  # Demand ischemia:  During admission pt was noted to have an elevated Troponin level of 0.16 (which trended down) with negative CK and CK MBs. He was briefly anticoagulated on a heparin gtt due to initial concern for cardiac ischemia; however, this was later attributed to demand and heparin gtt was discontinued.  He was started on ASA 81 mg for primary cardiac prevention and was continued on his home statin. The ASA was stopped when concern for possible contribution of the ASA to his reactive airways.  # GIB: During his ICU stay the pt was noted to have BRBPR. he had been maintained on a PPI during his entire course. The Hct dropped but stabilized and transfusion was deferred at family request. GI was consulted but given that the Hct stabilized no emergent intervention was needed. GI saw pt prior to discharge and recommended an outpatient Endoscopy once pt has completed rehab.  # Myopathy: After extubation, the pt had a profound muscle weakness, possibly related to steroids. He failed a video swallow on [**2-19**] and a Dobhoff was placed. PT\/OT worked with the pt and recommended rehabilitation. At time of discharge pt still unable to raise his extremities against gravity but showed improvement with grip strength ([**3-9**]), internal\/external roation of the Upper extremities ([**2-7**]), able to move toes and internally\/externally rotate lower extremities ([**2-7**]).  # Hypertension: Pt has a history of hypertension for which prior to discharge he was maintained on Cardizem 30mg four times a day.  # Oral Candidasis: Pt was noted to have oral candidiasis was started on Nystatin swish and swallow.
