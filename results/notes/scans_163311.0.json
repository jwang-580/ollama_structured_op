CT head w\/o contrast ([**2140-7-19**]): This exam is slightly limited due to motion. Large area of encephalomalacia in the right basal ganglia and extending into the right frontal lobe are consistent with prior infarct. There is subsequent ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle. There is no definite evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct. Hypoattenuation extending superiorly from the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle may be due to an additional chronic infarct. There is no hemorrhage. The ventricles are prominent. The basal cisterns are preserved. Extensive mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells are likely chronic. . CXR PA\/lat ([**2140-7-19**]): The lungs are clear with no evidence of aspiration or pneumonia. The pleural surfaces are smooth with no effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. There is mild tortuosity of the aorta. Long gentle rightward thoracic scoliosis is noted. . ECG ([**2140-7-19**]): Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment changes, Q waves in anterior (I, aVL), inferior (II, III, aVF), and lateral (V4-V6) leads.  No ST segment or T wave changes. Low voltage.  "}]
