[{"0":" Mr. [**Known lastname 3419**] was taken to the operating room on [**2153-4-23**] for attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy; however he was converted to open due to extensive inflammation of his gallbladder.  Please see operative report for further details of the operation. Postoperatively he was transferred to the floor in stable condition on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  That evening he was transfused 1 unit of blood for low urine output, tachycardia, and hct of 26.  His hematocrit responded appropriately.  He did have some fevers overnight, but this was not completely unexpected given the nature of his operation.  On POD 1 his diet was advanced to clears and he was restarted on his bumex for chronic CHF.  In the late morning he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was unresponsive to boluses of lopressor and diltiazem, and he was also more hypotensive to SBP 90-100.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where drips of amiodarone and verapamil were also unsuccessful.  His troponins were mildly elevated but there was no evidence of active MI on his EKG or exam. Cardiology was [**Name (NI) 653**], he was he was chemically cardioverted with IV ibutilide x2 doses.  He spontaneouly reverted back to sinus rhythm overnight, and stayed in sinus for the remainder of his hospitalizaion.  Flagyl was added empirically to his antibiotic regimen for persistent fevers.  On POD 2 he was restarted on a regular diet, and he was restarted on his Coumadin on POD3.  His creatinine increased to 2.4 but returned to baseline with hydration.  On POD 4, his hematocrit was found to be 17, so he was transfused 2 units of blood.  He also had a CT without contrast, which revealed a 10 cm hematoma in his liver bed.  He was never tachycardic or hypotensive.  His hematocrit responded appropriately to the transfusion, and remained stable for the rest of his hospitalization.  From POD [**4-25**] his condition improved markedly - his fevers subsided, he regained bowel function, tolerated regular diet, and was ambulating independently.  He was restarted on his home dose of Coumadin on POD 6 and cleared by PT for discharge home on POD7.  "}]
