Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with 2 drug eluting stents to left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] is a 46 year old male with hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no coronary history who has had chest pain on and off for the past year over the left percordium. He notes that over the past two weeks he has had increased frequency of chest pain with exertion that occurs every other day. On [**2167-4-21**], while at work he developed worsening chest pain after walking up a flight of stairs that radiated down his left arm and was associated with nausea, anxiety, and dyspnea. He presented to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where he received 2 SL nitroglycerin tabs and became chest pain free. EKG showed NSR 76 bpm, < [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in II and III, no t wave inversions. He had an echo which was normal with LVEF 70%. He was found to have troponin I of 2.06, and was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin, metoprolol, quinapril, and omeprazole and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization. Vital signs were stable on transfer. . Here, he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed: 3 vessel disease with a 85% long lesion in the LAD, a distal 60% LCx lesion, and total proximal PDA occlusion with collaterals from the LAD. The RPDA was suspected to be the culprit for NSTEMI. However, a PCI of the RPDA was thought to be difficult due to severe tortuousity of the RCA. Discussed PCI vs CABG with patient on his daughter who is a [**Hospital1 18**] nurse. The patient declined CABG and had PCI with 2 overlapping DES (Cyphers) to the LAD. . The patient continued to have persistent chest pain after the procedure and appeared unwell. He also complained of back pain and had blood pressure in the 200s. There was concern for dissection so he was admitted to the CCU for monitoring. He was started on a nitro gtt. . Upon arriving to the floor the patient is comfortable with 1\/10 chest discomfort and blood pressures 120s\/70s. He also complains of back ache that is consistent with his chronic back pain that he beleives is musculoskeletal. Otherwise he denies complaint.   Past Medical History: 1. Dyslipidemia 2.
