[{"0":" ASSESSMENT & PLAN: A 55-year-old homeless gentleman admitted to the MICU for upper GI bleed and alcohol withdrawal.  He is not acting as though he is having a major GI bleed as the cause of his symptoms, nor is there any clear source of infection or underlying pathology to explain why he would withdraw at this time. He is comfortable at the time of admission. . #. Hematemesis:  The patient had one episode of nausea\/hematemesis after receiving PO Potasssium.  He denied any nausea or vomiting and was guaiac negative.   Last EGD [**2119**] with no varices but does have known liver disease.  No evidence of ongoing bleeding, abdominal pain, etc. Possible etiologies include variceal bleed, ulcer disease or [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear (if he has vomited in the past few days). He was given Protonix IV BID.  Serial Hct were stable.  Liver was consulted and agreed to do endoscopy non-urgently; however, given patient was hemodynamically unstable due to withdraw (tachycardia, agitated, tachypnic)- this was deferred to an outpatient process. Patient was discharged with these appointments and instructions. . #. Tachycardia:  Initially sinus tachy to the 110s-130s, likely secondary to fever, EtOH withdrawal, and fluid depletion.  His BP was consistently normal to high.  Home anti-hypertensive (atenolol) was changed to half the equivalent dose of metoprolol.  This was additionally titrated up prior to discharge.  His heart rate came down appropriately. . # Fever and infiltrate:  CXR and CT indicated LLL pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration.  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started for CAP, he continued to spike.  Antibiotics were swtiched to levofloxacin and flagyl.  Fever resolved and he improved clinically at time of discharge. . #. Elevated transaminases: History of Hep B\/C.  LFTs elevated somewhat above previous values on admission.  Liver followed and will continue to as outpatient.  #. Alcohol withdrawal:  Patient, tachycardic, tremulous, anxious. No history of withdrawal seizures per patient.  He was initially given diazepam IV per CIWA, then converted to PO. Thiamine, folate, MVI were started.  #. Elevated Anion Gap: Patient's anion Gap 34.  Given a lactate of 4 reducing with fluids, this likely represented alcoholic and starvation ketoacidosis. Gap closed after hydration.  #. Abnormal U\/A: + Hematuria possibly myoglobin from muscle damage as 0 RBCs on sediment. Urine culture was negative.  #. Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus, will hold anticoagulation given bleed.  He was placed on his home medications at the time of discharge.  #. H\/o hypertension: Will permit him to be mildly hypertensive as he is now, will control hypertension via withdrawal as above and address any urgency without beta blockade given GI bleed.  # CODE: Full  # Discharge: Patient demanded to leave multiple times during his stay.  He initially refused EGD and all testing.  Psychiatry was called to evaluate patients ability to make decisions.  He voiced appropriate understanding of the pros and cons of having the procedure and that he understood the reasons of why we want he to get the test (please refer to omr for full note).  He contiued to be belligerant and threatening to his medical team. On the day of discharge, he demanded to be leave the hospital with or without the approval of his medical team.
