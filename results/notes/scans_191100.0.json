CT: HISTORY: Cholangitis, status post ERCP with stent placement.  TECHNIQUE\/FINDINGS: Initial MDCT axial images through the abdomen were obtained for guidance for this patient's drainage. The lung bases demonstrate bilateral dependent atelectases and small pleural effusions. The heart is enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. The liver and spleen appear within normal limits. The gallbladder is markedly distended with gallstones. A biliary stent is seen. Pericholecystic fluid and soft tissue stranding is noted. The right kidney is atrophic. There is a 2.3-cm hypodense nodule in the lower pole of the right kidney. In addition, a 1.7-cm hypodense nodule is seen in the lower pole of the left kidney, not fully characterized in this non- contrast study. The patient is status post CABG.  After explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure, informed consent was obtained from the patient's wife. The patient was placed in supine position. The right upper quadrant was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was used for topical anesthesia.  An 8 French pigtail catheter was advanced into the gallbladder. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.  IMPRESSION: Successful placement of an 8 French percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter.  Hypotrophic right kidney and bilateral renal hypodense lesions, not fully characterized on this non- contrast study. Further evaluation with MRI could be performed when feasible.   "}]
