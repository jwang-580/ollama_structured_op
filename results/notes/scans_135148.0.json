A standard central venous access line is placed in the right internal jugular vein, the tip of the left catheter projects over the brachiocephalic vein, the tip of the right catheter projects over the azygos vein. Right-sided tracheostomy tube. Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly and right-sided perihilar haze could be indicative of mild pulmonary fluid overload. Bilateral subtle fibrotic changes, most obvious in the retrocardiac lung areas, could represent fibrotic scars after old infection. No evidence of recent infectious lung disease.  PICC placement - IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach. Final internal length is 41 cm, with the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.  "}]
