[{"0":" . #. Urosepsis: The pt presented with complaints of LLQ abdominal pain x 1 day prior to presentation. She was intially hypertensive but developed an altered mental status and BP dropped to 80s systolic. The pt was intubated for airway protection and had a central line placed for IVF resuscitation. Vancomycin and Unasyn were started. UA demonstrated evidence of UTI. Clinical presentation was consistent with pyelonephritis with bandemia, fevers, and hypotension.  CT scan with left perinephric fat stranding and asymmetrical enlargement with a small amount of free fluid is seen in the left paracolic gutter c\/w acute pyelonephritis. On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the pt remained hypotensive requiring levophed overnight. She received 6L NS. Her antibiotics were transitioned to cefepime and cipro. Vanco and unasyn were discontinued. Her blood cultures and urine cultures grew Citrobacter freundii - pansensitive and her antibiotics were tapered to cipro to complete a 14 day course for bacteremia and pyelonephritis. Surveillance cultures negative. . #. Altered mental status:  In the ED the pt had an acute MS change and required intubation for airway protection. This change was felt most likely related to severe sepsis. Initial CT Head was WNL. The patient had a persistently altered mental status, was minimally responsive to verbal stimuli despite weaning off sedation. Her fentanyl and versed were transitioned to dexmedetomidine as it was felt that her MS may be due to sensitivity to benzodiazepines. The pt briefly developed profound hypotension with the use of Dexmedetomidine requiring the initiation of levophed and neosynephrine. The Dexmedetomidine was discontinued abruptly and her hypotension resolved. Her sedation was changed to propofol and on her fifth hospital day the patient's altered mental status resolved and she was successfully extubated. AMS likely due to sepsis and benzodiazepine effect. Now with normal mental status. . # Respiratory distress: Occurred in the ED in the setting of fever, rigors. The patient has no underlying lung pathology. The patient was extubated although now CXR is fluid overloaded. Intubated in the ED.  The pt was extubated on [**5-24**] however required reintubation due to poor mental status and pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension. CT scan demonstrated evidence of volume overload. She was diuresed approx 3L prior to her successful extubation of [**5-27**]. . # Elevated CK: The pt had a CK elevation to 3000 on admission felt related to rigoring during sepsis vs a component of rhabdo secondary to either sepsis or electrolyte abnormalities ( ie hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia on admission). Also possible component of demand ischemia given elevated troponin but minimal MB fraction. She was treated with IVF and electrolyte repletion. CK trended down appropriately. . # Diabetes mellitus: Last A1c 12.9 in [**2101-4-4**]. The pt was started on an insulin gtt on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for tight glucose control. There was no evidence that she was in DKA. She was transitioned back to RISS and lantus 20 U in ICU. As her fsbg remained elevated, she was given 10 units lantus the following morning and told to take lantus 60 that night then her prior regimen of lantus 70 the following night. . # Hypercholesterolemia: Statin initially discontinued as pt presented with marked CK elevation. CKs trended down and other LFTs were within normal. Felt that this was no likely to be related to statin use. Therefore statin was restarted. . # GERD: - Continued PPI. . #CODE: FULL . #COMMUNICATION: [**Name (NI) **] (husband) [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 101417**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 6330**] (sister) [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 101418**]   "}]
