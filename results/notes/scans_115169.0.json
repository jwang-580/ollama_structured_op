No apparent extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation or irregularity is seen. No filling defects consistent with stones were noted. As per report, in subsequent images, biliary stent was successfully placed. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of biliary stent.  [**2175-8-9**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  [**2175-8-14**] ERCP FINDINGS: Comparison is made with CT from [**8-12**], [**2174**] and prior ERCP from [**2175-8-8**].  There is removal of a plastic stent. A retrograde cholangiogram shows multiple filling defects, some of which likely represent stones, within otherwise normal- appearing biliary tree. A biliary stent was then placed.   "}]
