DKA,       - Likely  Precipitated by infection vs med compliance,       - AG has closed, sugars improved.,       - Continue to monitor q1hr finger-stick's given high levels of,   exogenous insulin in the setting of renal failure.,       - Patient not eating; will continue insulin gtt,       - Can check BMPs q8hr,       - Based on 24hr insulin needs will determine daily SQ insulin,   regimen,       - Will notify patient's outpatient endocrinologist,   3. Abd pain, nausea,       - Likely secondary to gastroparesis.  Will correct sugars and when,   they are stable will start promotility agents.,       - Patient with bowel movements, so obstruction less likely.,   3. Renal failure,       - Patient with acute-on-chronic CKD, though baseline is ~ stage,   [**5-8**].,       - [**Name6 (MD) 59**] acute RRT needs,       - [**Name2 (NI) **] likely soon need initiation of RRT given progression of,   chronic disease.
