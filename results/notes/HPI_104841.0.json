The patient presented to his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2108-3-9**] with a chief complaint of malaise.  The patient was recently treated for an episode of possible bronchitis at the end of [**Month (only) 404**] with a course of moxifloxacin.  He reported he felt persistent productive cough since that time.  The cough has been productive of clear to white sputum.
