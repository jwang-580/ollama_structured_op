EKG [**2112-10-12**]: NSR @ 60bpm, no ectopy, LAD, PRWP (new since [**2111-3-25**]), normal PR and QRS intervals, QTc prolonged at 620ms, no LVH, no ST elevations\/depresions. . TELEMETRY:  Episodes of R on T and torsades noted on tele. . CHEST XRAY [**2112-10-13**]: PA and lateral chest radiograph. The mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again noted are aortic calcifications, most prominent at the aortic knob. There is interval removal of the dual-lumen dialysis catheter. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged and increased interstitial markings bilaterally are unchanged, compatible with mild interstitial edema. There are no pleural effusions. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear without new focal consolidations. In the low thoracic spine there is an apparent new anterior wedge deformity, which is not seen a year and a half ago. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 2. Mild anterior wedge deformity in a low thoracic vertebral body, new in the interval. . HEAD CT [**2112-10-13**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. No large territorial infarct, edema or mass effect are noted. The midline structures are normal. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, compatible with age-appropriate atrophy. There is periventricular and subcortical white matter disease, compatible with chronic small vessel ischemia. Again noted is a punctate calcific density in the right sylvian fissure, unchanged, and may represent a calcified granuloma, sequela of prior neurocysticercosis, or be vascular etiology. A non- aggressive- appearing lucent lesion is unchanged in the left frontal bone, previously thought to be a hemangioma. There is significant calcification in the distal vertebral arteries as well as the cavernous portions of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. . TTE [**2112-10-14**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Impression: extensive anterior, septal, and apical akinesis with moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least mild mitral regurgitation; moderate aortic stenosis. . Cardiac Cath [**2112-10-18**]: COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a hazy 80& stenosis right after the first septal branch. D1 had a proximal 60% stenosis. The Cx had no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid portion of the vessel. 2. Successful PCI of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x18mm Promus DES. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Successful PCI of the LAD with DES.   "}]
