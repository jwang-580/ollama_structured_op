The pt notes that she has been feeling increasingly SOB and weak over the last couple days, with an episode of dizziness \/ lightheadedness on the day prior to admission. The pt has not been eating well over the last few days and had an episode of nausea \/ vomiting on the day prior to admission as well. She had an abdominal ultrasound done on the day prior to admission for evaluation for paracentesis, and labs drawn that day showed worsening renal function, so she was called to come in to the ED today for evaluation. . On arrival in the ED: VS - Temp 97.5F, HR 100, BP 111\/70, R 20, O2-sat 91% RA. Labs were significant for K 7.8, BUN 116 \/ Cr 7.2, WBC 14.3 w\/ 92% PMNs, and lactate 2.0. CXR revealed a large left pleural effusion and ECG was low voltage. Pulsus was 10, so a bedside TTE was done to eval for tamponade, which revealed a mild pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. She was treated with IVF, calcium gluconate, insulin w\/ dextrose, Kayexelate, and albuterol nebs. She was also given levofloxacin x1 for ? pneumonia. She is being admitted to the MICU for evaluation and treatment of her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure. . The pt has a recent dx of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. Approx 6 weeks PTA, the pt started to feel tired and developed swollen legs and a distended abdomen. Evaluation revealed a mass on her right ovary that was to be removed, but CT scan prior to surgery also showed enlarged LNs, so the surgery was held off until a biopsy specimen could be taken of the lymph nodes. There is some thought that the cancer may be a lymphoma rather than primary ovarian.   Past Medical History: - Hypertension - Gallstones - Hyperlipidemia - Hypothyroidism   "}]
