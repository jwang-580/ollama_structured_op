[{"0":" ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] is a 46 YOM with hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with an NSTEMI   * NSTEMI:  The patient was chest pain free on arrival and had evidence of elevated biomarkers indicating NSTEMI.  He was taken for cardiac catheterization and was found to have 3 vessel disease.  He was offered surgery, but decided to undergo percutaneous intervention instead.  He had two drug eluting stents placed in the proximal-mid LAD.  The procedure had no complications, however, afterward he developed recurrent chest pain with hypertension (see below).  He became chestpain free after starting a nitro drip.  An echo was performed that showed EF of 70%.  Overnight he had a few runs of 8 beat NSVT, one episode of which he felt palpitations.  He was started on metoprolol.  He was discharged on full dose aspirin, plavix ([**Hospital1 **] for one week, then decreased to once a day), metoprolol XL, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and SL nitroglycerin PRN.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] on [**2167-5-8**]. . * Chest\/back pain:  Following his catheterization, the patient developed chest discomfort and also complained of back pain. The initial concern was for aortic dissection because of the back pain in the setting of hypertension to the 200s so the patient was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring and management.  However when the patient reached the ICU he was comfortable, with blood pressures in the 120s (symmetrically on both arms). He denied any new back pain beyond his baseline chronic musculoskeletal back pain.  It was then thought that dissection was much lower on the differential given his clinical improvement and he did not undergo CTA. Causes for the persistent chest discomfort were thought to be from ongoing ischemia, microembolization from the stents, or pain from manipulation and stenting of the LAD. . * Hypertensive urgency\/Emergency:  Following his catheterization and stents, Mr. [**Known lastname 85934**] was found to have BP 200 along with chest and back discomfort.  He was started on nitro drip for hypertensive urgency and he became chest pain free and had SBPs in the high 120s.  His nitro drip was weaned and he was started on 12.5 mg captopril TID and 25 mg metoprolol tartrate TID.  His blood pressure remained well controlled in the 120s.  He was discharged on once daily metoprolol succinate 50 mg and lisinopril 5 mg. . * Hyperlipidemia:  The patient's lipid profile revealed elevated lipids with LDL 171, HDL 31, tryglycerides 258, and total cholesterol 254.  He was started on atorvastatin 80 mg once a day.  He should have his LFT's and lipid panel rechecked in 6 weeks.  .  "}]
