[{"0":" A\/P: 74 yof h\/o bilateral PE's, AF, COPD, CAD and dementia, s\/p completion of 10 day course for HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime, transferred from nursing home for concern of alt. mental status with inc. lethargy and found to be CO2 retaining. . #. CO2 Retention: endorses h\/o COPD and smoking but unable to elaborate further. [**Month\/Year (2) 1570**]'s strongly suggestive of obstructive lung disease. At baseline, ABG's reveal element of CO2 retention with CO2's ranging from 50-70's. Unclear whether CO2 retention was exacerbated by over resucitation with O2 OR whether COPD flare led to CO2 retention and AMS. Patient did not endorse SOB, fevers, chills or additional infectious Sx and patient is s\/p full 10 day course of IV ABx. At admission patient was placed on BIPAP with rapid improvement of her ABG and mental status. Patient was NOT noted to be fluid overloaded and likley picture represented COPD exacerbation s\/p recent PNA. Patient was maintained on PRN nebs. She did not experience any nocturnal desaturations and mental status remained at baseline throughout hospitalization. Pulmonology was consulted regarding potential evaluation for nocturnal BIPAP for COPD treatment and arrangements were made at the time of discharge for pulmonology follow up for further evaluation and management. . #. Altered Mental Status: AMS was attributed to CO2 retention, strengthened by rapid improvement with BIPAP.  Neuro exam was non-focal and imaging was not suggestive of any acute event. At baseline patient is interactive, able to answer questions and follow commands. She is oriented only to self. . #. Pneumonia: initial CXR was a poor study with low lung volumes with possible continued retrocardiac infiltrate. Patient was afebrile with normal WBC count. Antibiotics were continued to complete 10 day course from prior admission for HCAP.  This was felt to likely represent treated PNA with residual CXR changes. Further antibiotics were deferred. . # DM II: patient was initially hypoglycemic at admission but easily correct with improvement mental status. This episode may have contributed to overall clouded clinical picture.  Patient was maintained on ISS and her regular daily insulin regimine was continued at discharge. . # AF: patient remained rate controlled throughout stay.  She was monitored on telemitry throughout her stay on the floor. Metoprolol, diltiazem and coumadin were continued.
