[{"0":" Pertinent Results: . INR the day of discharge:  2.5 . MRI of back: CLINICAL INDICATION: 34-year-old male with history of IV drug use, endocarditis requiring mechanical valve, now presenting with fevers, low back pain, and spinal tenderness. Please evaluate for epidural abscess.  TECHNIQUE: MR images of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine were obtained including T2 sagittal, T1 sagittal, sagittal STIR, axial GRE, sagittal STIR, and axial T2 sequences.  This exam is limited by patient motion, with the GRE sequences quite limited by pulsation artifact, and no axial images of the lower lumbar spine or lumbar STIR sequence. Finally, the patient declined additional imaging, including post-contrast sequences.  FINDINGS:  Within the cervical spine, the vertebral body height and alignment are normal. There is normal cord signal and morphology. The paraspinal soft tissues are normal.  At C2\/3, there is no evidence of disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing.  At C3\/4, there is a mild disc bulge with no spinal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.  At C4\/5, there is a disc bulge that is eccentric to the left that abuts the left ventral cord. There is mild left neural foraminal narrowing.  At C5\/6, there is a left paracentral disc bulge with effacement of the left ventral cord and left neural foraminal narrowing. The right neural foramen is patent.  At C6\/7, there is a broad-based central disc herniation that effaces the ventral thecal sac. The neural foramina are patent.  At C7\/T1, there is no evidence of disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing.  THORACIC SPINE:  The vertebral body height, alignment, and bone marrow signal of the thoracic spine are normal. There is no abnormal cord signal or morphology. There is no disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal narrowing. There is no evidence of abscess. Sagittal STIR sequence demonstrates no abnormal signal.  LUMBAR SPINE:  The vertebral body height and alignment are normal. The conus has normal signal and morphology and terminates at L1. Axial images of the lower lumbar spine were not performed due to patient not wanting to continue with the exam. The paraspinal soft tissues demonstrate no abnormality. Sagittal T1 sequence demonstrates a shallow disc protrusion at L5\/S1 with associated annular tear. The remainder of the sagittal images demonstrates no evidence of disc herniation.  IMPRESSION:  1. No non-contrast evidence of discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis or epidural abscess in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine.  2. The evaluation of the leptomeninges and nerve roots is quite limited due to the lack of gadolinium contrast.  3. Multilevel cervical spondylosis, with ventral canal and neural foraminal narrowing, most marked at the C4\/5 through C6\/7 levels.  4. Shallow disc protrusion at L5\/S1 with associated annular tear.   "}]
