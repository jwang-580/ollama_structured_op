[{"0":" 74M w\/ CAD s\/p CABGx2, DM, gout, [**Hospital 2091**] transferred from OSH with cholangitis and gallstones with positive troponins in the setting of ARF\/CKD. . For his cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis: Pt was admitted from OSH after an extensive negative GI workup for RUQ pain on Unasyn, admitted after clearance of NSTEMI, for ERCP emergently. Exploratory ECRP demonstrated gross pus in the stomach and spilling from the papilla, and a biliary stent was placed. Zosyn was started pre-procedure and continued post-procedure for a 7 day course (8\/12\/008-8\/19\/08). A cholecystomy tube was placed percutaneously, and elective cholecystectomy was deferred by general surgery until the near future. LFTs trended down throughout his ICU stay.  Amylase and lipase rose transiently suggestive of post ERCP pancreatitis but trended downwards by POD2. He will have a percutaneous cholecystomy tube remain in place until he is seen in Surgery Clinic for consideration of cholecystectomy. . Acute on chronic renal failure: He presented in prerenal ARF with Cr ~6, with likely component of oliguric ATN [**1-27**] CHF with kidney hypoperfusion. He displayed indications for HD including acidemia, hyperkalemia, and uremic encephalopathy. Nephrology was consulted regarding need for HD and placed a hemodialysis catheter for hemodialysis.  He received dialysis on [**2120-8-10**]. After hemodialysis, pt's UOP picked up to 40-150 cc\/hr, with Cr recovering to 2.2 by discharge.  He received dialysis on [**2120-8-12**] for volume overload and 2L were taken off.  His AceI, colchicine, statin, lasix were held due to renal failure. His ACE inhibitor was restarted. He will need to restart the Lasix at his rehabilitation facility. . Mental status change: related to uremic encephalopathy given renal failure but there was also convern for bacteremia possible related to biliary sepsis. Blood cx were negative. Urine cx were positive (already covered with zosyn). NH3 levels from OSH (51) were normal at 10 by ICU day7. Pt. returned to baseline mental status on day 7. . NSTEMI: likely [**1-27**] to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and ARF\/CKD, as opposed to NSTEMI. Troponins were elevated from OSH on heparin gtt, peaking at trop 2.19 on ICU day 6 ([**2120-8-12**]). ECG showed sinus rhythm, RBBB with ST depressions in V2-V4 and terminal deflection in qrs but not significantly changed from prior tracings. ECHO showed EF 40% which is unchanged from prior, mild-moderate systolic dysfunction, symmetric LVH, and mild MR. Pt was started on Asa and metoprolol, and restarted on an ACE inhibitor. Pt was recommended to have outpatient MIBI by cardiology. . Restrictive lung disease\/COPD: OBstructive disease [**1-27**] COPD with superimposed Chest wall dysfunction [**1-27**] obesity and deconditioning and restarted on home atrovent and encouraged to use incentive spirometry.  . Bilateral pleural opacities in LLL, RLL: Thought to be [**1-27**] fluid overload, atelectasis.  His lasix was held given his renal status, so he was dialyzed on [**8-12**] to try to improve fluid status, also OOB to chair. . DM: He was continued on insulin sliding scale. His pioglitazone was held. He will need reinitation of glargine insulin when he is eating well. . Gout: Patient has a history of gout, and had pain in his joints secondary to gout. This was treated with narcotics, including oxycodone and Tylenol #3. . Anemia: normocytic Hct 30 down from baseline of 37-40, likely related to CKD, Fe deficiency given hx of GIB with possible malnutrition. He was transfused one unit of pRBC. His stool was guaiac negative. His hematocrit remained stable for the rest of his hospital stay. . PVD: Hx of TIA, PVD, and carotid stenosis b\/l. continue Asa. . CHF: ECHO from [**2115**] shows EF 50%, with inferior basal hypokinesis and the ECHO obtained in the ICU did not show interval development of wall mortion abnormalities. Lasix was held while he was in ARF.  "}]
