The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. No acute fracture. Visualized portions of paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.  IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial mass effect to suggest underlying mass. Note that CT has limited sensitivity for detection of metastasis and MR can be obtained as clinically indicated.  ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are multiple subcm. regions of low density in the basal ganglia regions bilaterally, as well as the head of the right caudate nucleus. No overt mass effect is seen from these admittedly small lesions. Most likely, they represent small vessel infarcts, subacute to chronic in age, but as noted above, MRI would help to confirm or refute this diagnosis. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] calling the housetaff to inform them of this amended finding, and also to inquire as to whether there are any known vascular disease risk factors that may predispose this patient to infarction.  There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the distal right vertebral artery, and to a minimal degree, the distal left vertebral artery, both at the level of the foramen magnum as well as the cavernous internal carotid arteries.
