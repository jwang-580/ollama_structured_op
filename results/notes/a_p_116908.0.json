[{"0":" Mrs. [**Known lastname 10840**] is an 83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholantitis presenting with fever, altered mental status concerning for ascending cholangitis.  #. Sepsis: Pt presented with altered mental status, fevers, tachycardia and leukocytosis. Symptoms were presumed to be due to cholangitis and obstruction of known biliary stent, given elevated white blood cell count, fevers, and elevated liver function tests. There were no other clear sources of infection on admission. A RUQ ultrasound showed no change in biliary dilitation but ERCP showed sludge and stones obstructing the stent which were successfully cleared out. Pt was initially empirically treated linezolid, ceftriaxone and flagyl given prior h\/o VRE and resistent bacteria, and transitioned to only high dose ceftriaxone once blood cultures grew Klebsiella. She was also treated with IVF boluses via PICC and did not require a CVL or pressors. The biliary surgery and ERCP team followed along during her stay. The infectious disease team helped guide appropriate antibiotic choice: as she did not have evidence of active hepatic abscesses on abdominal CT, a 2 week course was deemed sufficient (last day [**3-28**]). Her mental status returned to baseline, and her fevers resolved within a few days of hospitalization. Her blood cutlures checked after the initial positive results remained sterile.  #. Coagulopathy: On presentation pt's INR was 8, likely in setting of poor hepatic clearance of coumadin. She had no signs of active bleeding. She recieved several doses of Vitamin K and FFP to reverse her INR for ERCP and was NOT restarted on anticoagulation post procedure, out of concern for needing future procedures. Benefits and downsides of anticoagulation can be discussed with pt's PCP given ongoing goals of care.  #. [**Name (NI) 20472**] Pt's home home glyburide was held and pt was monitored and treated with a sliding scale of insulin. This was not restarted after her procedures due to generally good blood sugar control; however, this can be restarted when necessary at rehab depending on her blood sugars.  #. Coronary artery disease: Patient's last echo was in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2169**], which demonstrated an EF of >55%, normal systolic function, mild MR. She was continued on her home statin, while her home anti-hypertensives were initially held in the setting of concern of hypotension while septic. Her metoprolol was started after her BP recovered.  #. Atrial fibrillation: Pt supratherpeutic on coumadin on arrival. This was not restarted due to ongoing discussions about goals of care. Metoprolol was restarted and titrated up to 50mg tid given episodes of afib with RVR in the ICU. This was backed down to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] after she was noted to be in sinus brady in the 50s on the floor. Digoxin was not restarted.  #. HTN: held home BP regimen on admission. Metoprolol was added back as above and lisinopril and HCTZ were added and titrated up after she became hypertensive on the floor. This can continue to be titrated as needed at rehab.  #. Parkinsons: continued Sinimet and Pramipexole  #. Concern for aspiration\/goals of care: the patient failed a video speech and swallow study after being called out of the ICU. The speech and swallow team discussed the possibility of a feeding tube with the patient and family in order to be able to provide adequate nutrition, but she and her husband were adamantly against this, as quality of life and being able to have the comfort of eating food were deemed to be more important; thus, speech and swallow recommended nectar thick liquids and pureed solids per her husband's request. The patient and husband acknowledged the risks that she will likely aspirate. Goals of care should continue to be discussed at rehab and any concern for aspiration should be discussed with the patient and husband before she is sent to the hospital in the event that she does aspirate, to see if they may decide not to hospitalize her in that situation.  ## CODE STATUS: DNR\/DNI  EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) 4906**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 105717**]   "}]
