CXR: AP SEMI-UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: This exam is limited due to AP semi-upright technique. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions as well as probable bibasilar atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded as the lung bases are not well visualized. The lung apices appear unremarkable. The aorta is again tortuous.  IMPRESSION: Limited study. Moderate bibasilar effusions and atelectasis; superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. . Video Swallow: ASPIRATION\/PENETRATION: The patient aspirated a moderate amount of nectar and thin liquid. Prompting was required for throat clearing, which resulted in only partial clearance of the aspirated material.  IMPRESSION: Silent aspiration of moderate amounts of thin and nectar-thick liquids.     "}]
