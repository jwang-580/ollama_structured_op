There is no pericardial effusion. The patient is status post RFA of right liver lobe lesion. Small amount of hyperdensity in the RFA site likely represents coagulation necrosis versus hemorrhage(2, 11). There is no evidence of active extravasation. Mild hyperemia surrounding the RFA site is also noted. There is tubular dilation adjacent to RFA site likely representing mild degree of focal biliary obstruction secondary to RFA. The liver appears nodular and shrunken consistent with cirrhosis. A persistent arterially enhancing lesion within the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver (3A, 40) is unchanged.  Multiple subcentimeter hypodense lesions are identified (3B, 118) and (3B, 113). The two subcentimeter hypodensities adjacent to the RFA site (3B, 114) was not definitely seen on prior exam. There has been interval development of complete occlusion of the right portal vein (3B, 117) since [**2120-3-6**], and worse since [**2120-4-17**]. Small amount of non-occlusive thrombus is identified within the main portal vein. There is complete occlusion of the SMV which is also new since [**2120-3-6**] and slightly worse when compared to [**2120-4-17**] (3B, 147). The celiac artery, hepatic artery, SMA and renal arteries are patent. Within the left adrenal gland, there is a nodule, unchanged measuring 1.3 cm, previously characterized as adenoma. The right adrenal gland is unremarkable. The right kidney is stable. The left kidney contains a hypodense lesion which is consistent with a simple cyst measuring 1.7 x 2.5 cm. Extensive esophageal varices are unchanged. The gallbladder contains stones. There is mild bowel wall thickening involving the small bowel loops in the right lower quadrant as well as the cecum and ascending colon. Stranding within the mesentery of these small bowel loops as well as small amount of free fluid in the dependent portions of the pelvis are also identified. These findings are new when compared to prior exams. There is no evidence of pneumatosis or free air. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. A fat-containing midline hernia is unchanged. CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis. There is no evidence of acute diverticulitis. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The bladder is unremarkable. The uterus is stable. BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post right hip replacement. Multilevel degenerative changes are unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval worsening of right portal vein occlusive thrombus and thrombus extending within the SMV when compared to prior exams. Small bowel loops in the right lower quadrant as well as cecum and ascending colon appear thickened with a small amount of fat stranding and fluid within the mesentery. These findings are highly concerning for ischemia due to venous congestion, given vascular findings. 2. Cirrhotic-appearing liver. Status post RFA ablation. No evidence of active extravasation. 3. Liver hypodense lesions and arterial enhancing lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Close interval follow up and definitive characterization is recommended. 4. Gallbladder stones. 5. Large right pleural effusion. 6. Left adrenal adenoma. 7. Diverticulosis. . CXR [**2120-4-21**]: New mild to moderate right-sided pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. Cannot rule out small superimposed consolidation in the right base. . CT CHEST [**4-23**] - FINDINGS: A large right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion is increased in size from [**2120-4-21**], and causes near complete collapse of the right lung, with only partial aeration of the right middle and upper lobes. The effusion also exhibits severe mass effect on the trachea with near apposition of the anterior and posterior walls of the trachea, as the AP diameter of the trachea measures only 2 mm maximally. Similarly, there is near complete collapse of the bronchus intermedius and right lower lobe bronchus. A small left pleural effusion is associated with minimal basal atelectasis.  Septal thickening in the left lung suggests mild interstitial edema.  The heart is mildly enlarged, without pericardial effusion. Minimal  coronary artery and aortic arch atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. A hypoattenuating lesion in the dome of the liver, with central areas of high attenuation, reflects the RF ablation site and is better characterized on the CT of the abdomen performed just 2 days ago. Additional smaller hypodensities in the right lobe are too small to characterize. The previously characterized thrombosis of the right portal vein is better also assessed on prior study. Small perihepatic free fluid is new. A left adrenal nodule and renal cyst are stable. No lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Large non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion, causing critical mass effect on the trachea, which is nearly completely collapsed. 2. Near complete collapse of the right lung, with partial aeration of the right middle and upper lobes. 3. Mild interstitial edema in the left lung, with a small left pleural effusion. 4. Mild cardiomegaly . CXR [**2120-4-26**] - CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Mild cardiomegaly with a tortuous aorta is stable.  The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. No pneumothorax is identified. IMPRESSION: Stable small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist . TTE [**2120-4-30**] - LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.  RIGHT ATRIUM\/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.  LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.  AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.  AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.  MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.  PULMONIC VALVE\/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS. Physiologic PR.  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.  GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Ascites. Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2101-9-28**], mild left ventricular hypertrophy is now detected.   "}]
