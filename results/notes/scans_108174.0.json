EKG demonstrated NSR with q waves in III and AVF, TWI in II, III, AVF, 1 mm STE in V1, STD in V3, V4. . 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2193-7-23**] demonstrated: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior\/inferolateral akinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] EF 45%.  Right ventricular chamber size is normal and free wall motion is probably normal (views suboptimal). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. . CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2193-7-23**] demonstrated: The LMCA, LAD, LCX showed no obstructive coronary artery disease. The RCA showed a distal discrete 100% stenosis with left to right collaterals. . CXR [**2193-7-23**] AP single view of the chest is obtained with patient in supine position. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 3 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube has been placed and reaches far below the diaphragm. There is marked cardiac enlargement configuration indicating a prominence of the left ventricular contour as well as a beginning double contour and widening of the tracheal bifurcation indicative of left atrial enlargement. There is no pneumothorax. There are bilateral mostly centrally located parenchymal densities consistent with pulmonary edema. The lateral pleural sinuses are free. Possibility of some bilateral pleural effusions layering in the posterior pleural spaces in this patient in supine position can, however, not be excluded. . MRA Head. [**2193-7-28**]. CONCLUSION: Findings remain suspicious for multiple infarcts, shown to be subacute in age. . Renal Biopsy.  [**2193-8-2**]. Comment: 1.  There is no evidence of an immune complex glomerulonephritis. 2.  The focal vascular changes noted are insufficient for a definite diagnosis of a thrombotic microangiopathy.  Clinical correlation is indicated. . Skin biopsy: Multiple thrombi within small vessels in dermis with overlying ischemic epidermal changes consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. No vasculitis is seen.  Echo [**9-19**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis\/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Transmitral Doppler imaging is consistent with Grade III\/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-4**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased. Severe ischemic mitral regurgitation resulting from the mitral leaflets failing to coapt is unchanged.  Echo [**9-21**]: The left and right atrium are markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akineis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-19**], the findings are similar.  [**9-18**] Renal Ultrasound: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.9 cm, and the left kidney measures 10.2 cm. No hydronephrosis is identified in either kidney. The cortical thickness appears normal bilaterally. No cysts or solid masses are identified.  IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Normal cortical thickness bilaterally.  SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.    DIAGNOSIS:  MILDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH DYSERYTHROPOIESIS AND DYSMEGAKARYOPOIESIS.    Note: The findings are not inconsistent with the effects of gangcyclovir +\/- viremia.  A primary myelodysplastic syndrome appears less likely, but can not be entirely ruled out.  Special stains for microorganisms (Acid-fast, GMS, PAS) are negative. By immunohistochemistry, T-cell markers CD3 and CD5 highlight lymphocytes singly and in clusters.  CD20 is immunoreactive in a small subset.  CD138 highlights plasma cells in interstitial and perivascular distribution, which by Kappa\/Lambda light chain immunostaining appear polytypic.      MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  Peripheral Blood Smear:  The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes show significant anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils, macrocytes, target cells, echinocytes, dacrocytes, microcytes, ovalocytes and basophilic stippling.   A peripheral blood smear was not submitted.  Numerous nucleated RBC's are seen, some with irregular nuclear contours and asymmetric nuclear budding.   The white blood cell count appears normal.  Neutrophils with toxic vacuolization are prominent and include hypogranular forms. Platelet count appears normal.  Large forms are seen. Occasional Giant forms are present.  Differential count shows 91% neutrophils, 3% monocytes,  8% lymphocytes, 1% other myelocyte.    Aspirate Smear:  The aspirate material is inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.    Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of two pieces of fragmented core biopsy with partial aspiration artifact measuring 0.6 cm in aggregate. The marrow is variably cellular, overall 20-30%.  Interstitial debris and macrophages appear prominent.  The M:E ratio estimate is decreased.  Erythroid precursors are relatively increased in number and show occasional dysplastic forms (asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular nuclear contours).  Myeloid elements are decreased and show full-spectrum maturation.  Megakaryocytes are present in normal number and are focally present in clusters.  There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells \/ lymphoplasmacytic cells occurring singly and in small clusters occupying 10% of marrow cellularity.   Marrow clot section is similar to the biopsy.    Special Stains:  Iron stain is inadequate for evaluation due to lack of spicules.    "}]
