[{"0":" This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of multiple bacteremias due to gangrene of the right great toe (initially precipitated by anatomical abnormality), myelodysplastic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease presenting from rehab with fever and hypotension and found to be bacteremic again.  1) Bacteremia\/Sepsis: Patient was clearly septic at presentation with hypotension requiring norepinehprine on the night of admission and positive blood cultures for MRSA.  On presentation to the ICU the patient received his daptomycin as well as a dose of pipercillin-tazobactam for broad coverage.  Outside hospital blood cultures revealed MRSA, pan-sensitive klebsiella, and two kinds of streptococcus.  After spending one night in the ICU the patient defervesced and was able to be quickly weaned off norepinephrine.  He was transferred to the floor on his second hospital day and remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile. The most likely etiology of his recurrent bacteremia was considered to be his right great toe, which was status post multiple debridements, so this was amputated on [**2146-4-12**].  In order to rule out other sources of infection the patient had a CT abdomen and pelvis on recommendation on the infectious disease consult team, which showed no clear etiology of bacteremia though this was a suboptimal study due to the lack of IV contrast.  Given bacteremia with a PICC line in place the patient's PICC was discontinued on the recommendation of the ID consult service.  Surveillance cultures were persistently negative except for one set on [**2146-4-13**], which showed S. aureus raising concern for a persistent source of infection.  Given the patient has a pacemaker in place and had MRSA bacteremia there was concern for seeding, therefore TEE was considered necessary.  TEE did not show evidence of vegetations, but showed fibrous changes along the leads of Mr [**Known lastname 68840**] pacemaker. Despite being on Daptomycin for MRSA and Ceftriaxone for Klebsiella, the pt continued to have positive blood cultures following amputation of the toe and TEE. The infectious disease service recommended removal of the pacemaker, but after discussion with Mr [**Known lastname 3012**] and his health care proxies (daughter [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and her husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]), it was clear that the pt did not desire this aggressive approach to the treatment of his bacteremia. Mr [**Known lastname 3012**] accepted the fact that without pacemaker extraction his life expectancy would likely be limited to weeks (according to the ID service) and the decision was made for the pt to go home with hospice, on antibiotics for comfort. The pt was discharged on vancomycin 1g daily and rifampin on the recommendation of the ID service. . # Great toe gangrene: The patient has had chronic infection of his right great toe and he and his daughter had previously been unwilling to go through with amputation.  After he became bacteremic once again, however, they agreed to amputation.  This was performed by the vascular surgery service on [**2146-4-13**] without incident.  Pathology on bone specimens revealed changes consistent with chronic osteomyelitis. . # Myelodysplastic syndrome \/ thrombocytopenia: Patient has history of transfusion dependent thrombocytopenia and chronic anemia.  He was transfused in the hospital to maintaine Hct >25 and Plt >50 (prior to surgery) and Hct >25 thereafter. . # CKD: The patient has CKD with a baseline Cr of 1.7-1.9.  This improved throughout his hospitalization and was simply followed.  . # CAD\/CHF: Patient has a historical diagnosis of chronic systolic CHF with EF of approximately 40%.  He appeared euvolemic during this hospitalization.  Initially, his home furosemid dosing was held but then was restarted with stable blood pressures.  Despite a history of CAD the patient is not on aspirin, statin, or beta blocker. . # Delerium: The patient was initially with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status presumed to be multifactorial and due to his infection and perhaps an element of ICU delirium.  This improved with transfer to floor and resolution of hypotension as well as treatment of infection.  The patient would continue to have short periods of confusion even on the floor but these were always brief, worse at night, and more consistent with sundowning, which was not considered concerning given the patient's advanced age.  He always responded well to reorientation. . # Depression: The patient's mirtazapine was initially held given hypotension but then was restarted with good effect. . # BPH: The patient initially had a foley catheter in place and tamsulosin was held given his hypotension.  He was restarted on tamsulosin after 24 hours of normal blood pressures and his foley was discontinued without incident.  Prostate exam was performed as part of an infectious work up and revealed no tenderness and UA's were persistently benign. The pt was discharged with a condom catheter for urinary incontinence. . # Polymyalgia rheumatica: The patient has chronically (>1yr) been on prednisone for PMR.  He received stress dose IV hydrocortisone on presentation but was transitioned back to his baseline prednisone dose on the day after his surgery. . # Code status: Following the patient's decision not to remove the pacemaker, the pt elected to be DNR DNI. The pt was discharged to his home, with [**Hospital 3005**] Hospice.   "}]
