[{"0":" Imaging: CXR [**3-30**]: HISTORY: ARDS and COPD, admitted with upper GI bleed. FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2163-3-26**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications could reflect pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia, or even ARDS. Extensive respiratory motion somewhat blurs the resulting image.  CXR [**4-3**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities at low lung volumes and minimal pleural effusions. The image is consistent with ARDS. Moderate cardiomegaly. No interval recurrence of new parenchymal opacities.  CXR [**4-5**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with the underlying disease. Moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities, the presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
