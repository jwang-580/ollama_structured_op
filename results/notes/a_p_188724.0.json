[{"0":" This is a 75 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post CABG, EtOH abuse, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pacemaker placement who presented with probable viral gastroenteritis causing nausea, vomiting, and dehydration with hospital course complicated by C difficile colitis and pneumonia.  1) Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis in the context of poor PO intake and significant vomiting.  Given elevated lactic acid and improvement with IVF this was presumed due to dehydration in the patient's GI complaints and poor PO intake.  This had resolved by transfer to the floor and did not recur.  2) Nausea\/Vomiting: Given lack of any localizing signs of acute bacterial infection and lack of abdominal pain or other symptoms as well as lack of diarrhea on presentation this was thought most likely to be consistent with a rather severe case of viral gastroenteritis with dehydration exacerbated by the patient's generally poor self care and deconditioning.  As he had some right sided abdominal pain at presentation he also had an ultrasound of this area, which showed no choleycystitis.  The patient's symptoms improved with anti-emetics and he had less vomiting but he remained somewhat reluctant to eat out of fear of nausea.  He then developed C difficile colitis with frank diarrhea and had some worsening of his baseline nausea on PO metronidazole therapy.  Prior to discharge (on [**2201-3-31**]) he was switched to PO vancomycin given his persistent severe diarrhea and the patient's ICU stay suggesting he met criteria for severe disease and thus vancomycin might be the preferred [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  3) Dehydration: The patient was considerably dehydrated at presentation, presumably due to his vomiting nausea causing extremely poor PO intake in the context of baseline poor nutrition and poor self care.  This improved with IV fluids as well as the patient's general symptoms.  Given the patient's continued poor PO intake and nausea he continued to require IV fluid through the time of discharge to prevent dehydration and hypotension.  4) Acute Kidney Injury: His creatinine was elevated at 1.3 at presentation but had fallen back to 1.1-1.2, which is within this patient's normal range, by time of transfer back to the floor.  This was thought to be consistent with prerenal injury secondary to dehydration\/hypovolemia.  5) Hypoglycemia: Initial blood glucose of 40 at presentation. This was thought likely secondary to poor PO intake and alcohol use.  This resolved with dextrose and never recurred.  6) Clostridium Difficile Colitis: The patient did not have diarrhea or abdominal pain at presentation and had no history of antibiotic treatment.  Therefore, there were no major risk factors for C. difficile colitis and this was not checked.  When he developed diarrhea on [**2201-3-27**], however, the decision was made to check for C difficile colitis as he was post-ICU stay.  He remained afebrile and without abdominal pain.  When this assay returned positive he was started on metronidazole on [**2201-3-28**].  He was switched to PO vancomycin on [**2201-3-31**] given persistent nausea and concern this could be associated with metronidazole.  He will need to take this medication for at least seven days after discontinuation of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  7) Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma and had persistent issues with wheezing though he was never hypoxic on room air.  This was responsive to bronchodilators.  He may ultimately need combined inhaled corticosteroid therapy or more aggressive regimen in the long term but this was not initiated during his acute illness and in the context of possible pneumonia.  6) Delirium: The patient developed delirium on [**2201-3-27**] in the context of recent transfer to the floor and dehydration.  He went from alert and oriented *3 to alert and oriented *1.  He had a history of delirium and is probably predisposed to this due to chronic EtOH toxicity on the brain and age.  Dehydration and a possible pneumonia may have also contributed to his general appearance of toxic-metabolic delirium.  This resolved after approximately two days and he remained at baseline mental status.  7) Pneumonia: The patient's chest radiograph was benign at presentation but as of [**2201-3-28**] had developed a questionable infiltrate.  He remained afebrile at that time and really had no cough or other typical symptoms of pneumonia, but given his delirium this was treated as there was concern an infection could be contributing to his delirium.  Possibly, the patient had a pneumonia at presentation and this simply became more visible on chest radiograph after hydration.  He will need a total of ten days of levofloxacin therapy.  This was initially PO but switched to IV prior to discharge given the patient's poor PO intake and concern of malabsorption.  8) ETOH: ETOH level was 53 on presentation and the patient continued to report last drink on the evening of [**3-23**].  He has no history of complicated withdrawal and never showed clear signs of alcohol withdrawal.  The patient's CIWA scale was discontinued on [**2201-3-27**] as he had been having minimal scores on CIWA.  The patient was seen by social work to discuss his alcohol use.  9) Decubitus ulcer: The patient was incidentally noted to have a decubitus ulcer on presentation to the CCU.  This was presumably due to his minimal mobility at home and presumably somewhat to his poor nutrition.  There was never considerable erythema around this or frank purulence.  Good wound care was instituted and nutrition consult offered supplement suggestions that were implemented to help healing.  10) General Deconditioning: The patient was noted to be very weak and on examination by the PT service and was considered unsafe to return home unsupervised.  Acute rehab was recommended and the patient was initially reluctant to go to rehab but then agreed to go.  11) Anemia\/Thrombocytopenia: This is chronic and he has previously undergone bone marrow biopsy, which showed hypocellularity but no strict dyserythropoesis.  This is most likely due to chronic myelosuppresion due to his alcohol use. His anemia and thrombocytopenia remained stable throughout his hospitalization.  Haptoglobin was normal and no schistocytes on smear.  Prior to discharge the patient was tolerating very little PO but was intermittently consuming a low residue diet without event. He received SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was continued on his home H2 blocker for GI ppx.  He was full code.  His HCP was his separated wife, Mrs [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 653**] at [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 34376**] or [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 34377**].   "}]
