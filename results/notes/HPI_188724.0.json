He reports abdominal pain was a minimal portion of this syndrome. He reported some occasional right sided, non-radiating, non-exertional chest pain that had been going on about a month.   In the ED, VS:T98.3 HR94 BP120\/96 RR 20 98%RA.

He continued to have non-bloody and non-bilious but profuse emesis despite antiemetics.  He continued to vomit profusely while in the ED. Labs revealed an elevated lactate at 2.9 and an anion gap metabolic acidosis with HCO3 of 10.  VBG with pH of 7.19, HCT 32, Tn 0.03. He was transferred to medicine for further management.
