[{"0":" [**6-14**]: AXR:IMPRESSION: PD catheter with tip coiled in the pelvis. [**6-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Areas of hypoattenuation in the high bifrontal white matter, and subcortical hypoattenuation in the left posterior temporal lobe with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation. These findings are new from MRI brain [**12-29**], [**2140**], and could represent areas of new edema with underlying focal lesion or possibly areas of new infarcts. An MRI head without and with Iv conrast is recommended for further characterization. 2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  [**6-11**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There has been an interval increase in retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung and the left upper lung zone are clear. The right costophrenic angle is slightly blunted, suggesting a very small right pleural effusion. The heart is slightly enlarged, but the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no hilar enlargement. Soft tissue and bony structures are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: Interval increase in left basilar atelectasis with pleural effusion. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Possible small right pleural effusion.  [**6-11**]: MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: INDINGS: In comparison with a prior CT of the head, the previously described low attenuation areas in the parietal regions appear with hyperintensity signal on the FLAIR sequence, mildly hyperintense on the diffusion-weighted sequence, and also slightly hyperintense on the corresponding ADC maps, these findings are nonspecific and may represent posterior reversible encephalopathic changes, please correlate clinically. There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or midline shift. A low-attenuation area is identified on the right occipital region, likely consistent with chronic deposits of hemosiderin, please correlate with the prior MRI dated [**2140-12-28**].  IMPRESSION: Limited examination secondary to motion artifacts. On the FLAIR sequence, there is evidence of hyperintensity areas in the parietal regions, left occipital lobe, which are nonspecific and may represent possible posterior reversible encephalopathic changes. The prior low-attenuation area of the right occipital lobe is unchanged and may represent chronic deposits of hemosiderin. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or midline shifting. Followup with MRI of the head with and without contrast under conscious sedation is recommended if clinically warranted.  "}]
