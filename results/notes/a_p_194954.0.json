[{"0":" 50 M with advanced esophageal CA found unresponsive, with question of observed activity. . Patient was briefly admitted to the ICU for management prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 4601**] Oncology where patient receives majority of his care. . On Admission: . # Altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] found unresponsive. Differential is broad, toxic metabolic, ?narcotics related although minimal\/no response to narcan. ?seizure although no clear brain metastases. Patient now intubated and sedated for airway protection. ?atypical or viral source.  Mental status on admission showed intact brain stem reflexes w\/ reactive pupils, corneal blink, and no acute change in underlying mental status was observed during his ICU stay.  On admission to ICU, patient was initially covered with vancomycin and zosyn, but given concern for CNS infection was broadened to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin and flagyl at appropriate doses.  Plan was for urgent LP\/MRI\/EEG but work-up was interrupted by request of family and primary oncologist to have transfer to [**Hospital3 328**] for further care. EEG was performed and demonstrated no focal seizure activity with moderate global encephalopathy c\/w toxic\/metabolic process.  Plan at the time of discharge is for: - LP (plts marginal, will need plts pre LP), would send infectious\/viral studies in addition to routine labwork. - MRI\/MRA\/MRV w\/&w\/o contrast brain when able. - continue dilantin for now, 100mg IV TID, check albumin and dilantin trough in am goal level (adj for hypoalb [**11-21**]). trend  LFTs. - EEG as above - TSH: Pending - Neurology consulted and agrees with above plan. - Check peripheral smear for evaluation of TTP. . # Resp. Airway protection given MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 78607**] well, unable to extubate given altered mental status.  CT scan of the chest demonstates left lower lobe consolidation.  Blood cultures from admission growing 4\/4 bottles of gram positive cocci in pairs\/chains - likely strep pneumo.  Patient initially covered with vanc\/zosyn but after culture data returned, and given ? of CNS infection, patient changed to ceftriaxone in addition to vanc\/flagyl\/acyclovir\/ampicillin. - ABG stable, wean O2 as tolerated.  Extubation pending recovery of mental status. - mild sedation - wean qAM - sputum cultures . # Tachycardia. ECG sinus tachy. h\/o DVT, no PE on CTA. Likely related to underlying infection, fevers, ?pain. Volume status appears adequate. - mild sedation - monitor on tele . # Seizure Activity. No h\/o seizure. ?in setting of Narcan (patient seizured after receiving this at OSH). Per above, neuro w\/up.  EEG unremarkable.  Continue anti-epileptics and monitor levels. - Lesion on CT unlikely seizure focus as per neurology - MRA\/MRV\/EEG - consider LP for infection, toxic-metabolic w\/up . # Bandemia.  Likely related to infection, ? contribution of malignancy. . # Stranding on Abd CT: appears c\/w peritoneal mets from esophageal Ca.  ?Gut ischemia vs. infection. Belly soft on exam, evidence of dilated loops of small bowel with surrounding fluid\/stranding. Cover broadly for now. - consider surgical eval - serial abd exams - follow lactate . # Hyponatremia: Worsened with 2L NS on admission suggesting SIADH.  Appears euvolemic on exam so would continue to monitor HR, UOP. - Immediately prior to discharge: - Urine lytes -> Osm's 313 suggesting presence of ADH w\/ FeNa < 1% suggesting may be pre-renal.  Continue hydration as tolerated given concern for SIADH. . #Acute Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal but ATN concern given possibility of hypotension.  CK not elevated.  Urine lytes c\/w pre-renal.  Possibly some component of contrast nephropathy and but Cr elevated on admit.  Would monitor as given ARF and contrast load is high risk for contrast nephropathy. - Mucomyst 600mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 doses - Bicarbonate with IVF's. . # Esophageal CA.
