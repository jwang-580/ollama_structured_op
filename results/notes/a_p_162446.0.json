[{"0":" 67y\/o M with a PMH of DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical [**Hospital3 1291**] ([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]),CAD, s\/p CABG, hx of VF arrest s\/p AICD [**2175**], recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and hypotension, found to be in acute exacerbation of chronic systolic and diastolic CHF with flash pulmonary edema x2 requiring ventilation. . # CHF exacerbation with episodes of flash pulmonary edema: Patient presented with fluid overload, exacerbation of well known systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 20%).  Med nonadherence unlikely as pt presented from rehab facility.  Patient was diuresed aggressively with Lasix gtt, and was initially on nitrates for vasodilation.  However, when pt's SBP>100, he had flash pulmonary edema and needed intubation two times during this admission.  Captopril was initiated (in place of his Lisinopril, which was initially held for low BP) with the goal of aggressive afterload reduction, and pt was maintained at SBP<100.  Patient was also initiated on Torsemide and Diuril prn (received 1 dose so far) after Lasix drip was d\/c'ed to keep him negative 0.5-1L\/day to prevent volume overload and flash pulmonary edema.  <<*****He should continue to be diuresed to his dry weight on Torsemide and Diuril prn.*****>> Patient's flash pulmonary edema is also suspected to be related to vagal episodes with straining for bowel movements, and he is on an aggressive bowel regimen, which should only be decreased if the patient develops diarrhea.  <<*****Please maintain aggressive bowel regimen.*****>>  <<*****Please do NOT hold anti-hypertensive regimen (Captopril, Metoprolol) for SBP <80. Patient has flash pulmonary edema with SBP >100.*****>> . #  Hypotension: BP 80s\/50s at OSH, on Levophed initially, then weaned off. Initially believed to be [**1-26**] acute pulmonary edema and poor forward flow vs. sepsis (as pt had recent urosepsis and recently completed a 14 day course of meropenem for pseudomonas UTI).  UCx grew Klebsiella, BCx were negative, patient was treated with Meropenem.  Patient appears to live with SBP in 80's - 90's.  In fact, pt had flash pulmonary edema when SBP>100, and patient's goal SBP was <100 while in-house.  See above for course of medication changes with pt's low BPs. . # CAD s\/p recent cardiac cath:  Patient has known CAD s\/p CABG. Recent cath showed 2VD, patent LIMA to LAD, and diastolic dysfunction. No interventions were performed at that time. Pulmonary edema not believed to be [**1-26**] ACS, as negative cath 4 days prior to admission, without acute EKG changes, and essentially negative CEs.  Pt was continued on home Aspirin, statin.  BB and Lisinopril was initially held in the setting of hypotension initially, then re-started on Metoprolol as SBP stable in 80's-90's.  Lisinopril was changed to Captopril for afterload reduction, being discharged on 27.5mg tid. . # s\/p mechanical [**Month\/Day (2) 1291**]:  Pt was discharged on Heparin GTT just prior to re-admission, INR initially sub-therapeutic on Coumadin (and Heparin gtt).  INR became supra-therapeutic and Coumadin was held, then re-started and half dose with goal INR 2.5 - 3.5.  Heparin bridge continued until INR in therapeutic range prior to discharge. . # R leg ulcer - s\/p surgical debridement by VSurg [**9-8**]. Wound VAC placed [**9-9**].  Wound vac removed and leg was wrapped, vascular was re-consulted prior to discharge and stated pt can bear weight on the R leg. . # DM2 - On SSI with home Glargine 120 u qHS. . # ?Vision changes:  Ophtho was consulted for c\/o ?decreased vision; pt has cataracts OS>OD, no gross abnormalities, will need to keep his f\/u with ophtho at [**Last Name (un) **]. . # Hep C - Per Hepatology, deferred tx in-house, may need outpt reassessment in the future. . # h\/o VF - Pt does not have working pacer\/ICD at this time [**1-26**] persistent bacteremia that led to lead removal earlier this year. No indication for pacer\/ICD placement in-house, may need to be re-assessed for one in the future. . # h\/o Hypothyroidism - Pt not on thyroid replacement as outpatient. Last TSH wnl. . . *** Please do NOT hold anti-hypertensive regimen for SBP <80. Patient has flash pulmonary edema with SBP >100. . *** Please maintain aggressive bowel regimen. . *** Please continue diuresing -1L\/day.  Attempting to diurese to dry weight.  "}]
