[{"0":" Patient is a 61 year old male with coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava filter not on coumadin due to med non-compliance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and history of drug abuse, admitted with dyspnea and altered mental status.  1. Altered mental status:  The patient presented with altered mental status upon admission to the floor from the emergency department.  He was then immediately transferred to the ICU for further care, as there was concern for an atenolol overdose, with a heart rate in the 40s.  He has a history of overdosing on medications while hospitalized.  Narcan was given with good response, suggestive of a narcotic overdose.  The patient then had an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which was managed well with lasix IV.  Urine tox screen was positive for methadone and benzodiazepines.  The patient's altered mental status improved on [**9-2**], and the patient became alert and oriented x 3.  CIWA scale was started after transfer from the ICU to the floor, and was discontinued the next day after patient did not score. Initially, psychotropic meds were held.  As mental status improved, methadone and benzodiazepine therapy were restarted with recommendations from the psyciatry consult service.  The patient tolerated this well, and seroquel and duloxetine were also restarted.  It was thought that the patient's diminished mental status upon presentation was secondary to mild renal insufficiency in the setting of methadone and benzodiazapine therapy.  The patient was evaluated by psychiatry, given his history of anti-social personality disorder, depression\/anxiety, and polysubstance abuse in remission.  Psychiatric evaluation revealed a patient who was not psychotic, and did not have any active, acute psychiatric issues, and was deemed to have capacity.  There were no further mental status changes during the remainder of his hospitalization.  2. Pulmonary Edema:  The patient developed acute shortness of breath, tachypnea, and wheezing upon arrival to the ICU.  Plain chest film at this time showed evidence of pulmonary edema and fluid overload.  It was likely that the patient developed pulmonary edema, possibly in the setting of hypertension following Narcan administration.  The patient responded well to lasix IV.  Patient also experienced brief increased oxygen requirement on the floor, which again improved with lasix and bronchodilator\/anti-cholinergic therapy.  The patient was discharged on room air with clear lung sounds and no subjective shortness of breath.  3. history of pulmonary embolus status post inferior vena cava filter.  He was initially placed on heparin gtt in the ICU; however, after a conversation with the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] heparin gtt was stopped and the patient's anticoagulation was held.  The patient is a poor candidate for Coumadin, given his persistent noncompliance.  Anti-coagulation was held during his hospitalization secondary to medical non-compliance, and the patient was discharged without anti-coagulation.  4. polysubstance abuse in remission. Patient has history of substance abuse. He is on methadone maintance at baseline.  The methadone clinic was called today, and the patient's current dose is 125 mg daily.  He was thus restarted on his methadone after his mental status improved, and was continued on this dose for the duration of his hospital course.  5. UTI - The patient began complaining of dysuria and found to have a urine culture postive for pansensitive E. coli.  He was started on ciprofloxacin and told to complete a 7 day course  6. CAD - He had been discharged previously on metoprolol, but this was not restarted while in the hospital secondary to systolics in the 100s.  He is scheduled for follow up and should restart his metoprolol at that time. He was continued on his outpatient dose of Aspirin, simvastatin and lisinopril.  7. COPD - He was maintained on his nebulizers (albuterol, atrovent).  8. GERD - Stable.  continuted pantoprazole.  All other medical issues remained stable.  No other medication changes were made.   "}]
