Sputum gram stain showed few polys, few GPCs in pairs, rare GPCs in clusters; sputum cx grew scant normal respiratory flora. Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).  BNP was 1753.  Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.
