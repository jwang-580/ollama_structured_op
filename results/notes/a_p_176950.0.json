[{"0":" 64M w\/ pmh CAD p\/w chest pain, found to have anterior STEMI, complicated by V-fib arrest s\/p defibrillation, now s\/p cypher stent to prox LAD. . # ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Cardiac catheterization revealed a totally occluded RCA with Left to right collaterals, 99% stenosis of proximal LAD, and 40% stenosis of LCx.  He receiving a cypher stent to his proximal LAD and was admitted to the CCU.  During catheterization he was hypotensive, requiring a dopamine drip and an intraaortic balloon pump. He was intubated prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].  During the catheterization he was vomiting and concern was raised for aspiration. he was initially acidotic, with a pH of 7.01 and elevated lactate to 2.9. He was started on aspirin and plavix and atorvastatin, and his IV heparin was continued while he was still on the IABP. He underwent the arctic sun cooling protocol as well. he was also started on an insulin drip to keep his blood glucose under 180. Echo on [**2-5**] showed an LVEF of 30% with septal and anterior hypokinesis.  His RV was also dilated. After several days his blood pressure stabilized and his dopamine was discontinued on [**2-6**].  His balloon pump was removed [**2-6**].  He was extubated on [**2142-2-6**]. He was started on carvedilol and lisinopril, which were initially held given his hypotension. His carvedilol was switched to metoprolol and he was found to have better rate control with metoprolol. His enzymes were trended and found to peak at CK 2742, troponin 5.15.  Given his septal and anterior wall hypokinesis, the patient was bridged with enoxaparin and started on coumadin. He was started on 5mg coumadin daily from [**2-5**] to [**2-9**], his INR increased from 1.3 to 2.5.  He was then given 3mg of coumadin on [**2-10**] when his INR was 3.6.  His coumadin was held on [**2-11**].  The plan was to continue anticoagulation with goal INR [**3-12**] for 3-6 months and to re-evaluate in 1 month with repeat TTE and cardiac MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] will be discharged home on the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor for two weeks, with results followed up by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**].  By discharge, his systolic blood pressure was ranging between 100-140, and primarily in the 120s, and heart rate ranging from 60-85.  The patient was instructed to visit his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-12**], and [**2-13**] to have labs drawn to monitor his INR while on coumadin.  He was also instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from the department of Cardiology and Electrophysiology after his Cardiac MRI is performed.  The patient was also completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl for empiric coverage of aspiration pneumonia.   "}]
