[{"0":" Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 44 year old woman with long history of alcohol use and recent onset of end-stage liver disease and rapidly declining renal function transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for higher level of care.  At [**Hospital1 18**], she was getting lorazepam for withdrawal on the floor. She was progressively encephalopathic and was intubated on [**4-23**] for worsening respiratory status and transferred to the ICU.  MICU COURSE [**2147-4-23**] - [**2147-5-7**]:  # Alcoholic hepatitis: Most likely secondary to ETOH with probable underlying cirrhosis. Her discriminant function is > 140 which predicts high 30 day mortality of at least 50%. In this case, steroids would be recommended as soon as infection can be ruled out. She does have a leukocytosis.  She was pan-cultured. She was treated with octreotide and midodrine, 50 albumin x 3 days for HRS. Continued lactulose, added rifaximin. MICU COURSE: On hospital day #2, the patient developed worsening mental status and respiratory distress requiring intubation and was transferred to the medical ICU. She was started on prednisone on [**2147-4-24**] as well as on tube feeds for nutritional support. Her LFTs and coags were trended daily. Over the course of 1 week her total bilirubin trended down significantly from ~30 to ~16-18 so she was planned for a full 28-day course of steroids. In the setting of acute liver failure she developed acute renal failure (HRS vs. ATN) and coagulopathy with significant complications from bleeding (see below). She developed hypotension requiring pressure support (see below). After ~9 days of unresponsiveness, she began following commands and making eye contact and was able to be extubated 3 days later. She was initially confused (attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and recent extreme critical illness) but within 48 hours following extubation was alert, speaking regularly, and oriented to person, place [**Hospital1 18**] and date [**2147-5-6**]. She was therefore transferred back to the liver floor service.  # Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated for 12 days and maintained on sedation with propofol. Initially, she was unresponsive even with decreasing sedation, but after approximately 1 week began opening her eyes to voice and following commands. Multiple spontaneous breathing trials failed presumably secondary to excess fluid, so CVVH parameters were titrated to remove additional fluid and the patient was successfully extubated after ~12 days. During her MICU stay, she was treated empirically for HCAP based upon elevated WBC count and CXR findings for an 8-day course of vanco\/Zosyn ([**2147-4-29**] = Day #1).  # Acute renal failure: The patient developed worsening renal failure over the early course of her admission and was started on CVVH after transfer to the ICU. Per renal team recs, the etiology of her renal failure was more consistent with ATN than HRS, so octreotide was discontinued. Despite efforts to maintain fluid balance, the patient became virtually anuric and remained significantly volume overloaded. Efforts to remove additional fluid by CVVH were limited by hypotension initially. On [**2147-5-5**] CVVH was stopped and on [**2147-5-6**] hemodialysis was initiated. The patient tolerated her initial HD session very well with SBPs > 100.  # Coagulopathy, rectus sheath bleed: In the setting of liver failure as above, the patient developed anemia and thrombocytopenia (presumed secondary to suppressed production and splenic sequestration). However, on [**2147-4-29**] her Hct and platelet counts dropped significantly; imaging by CT ultimately revealed a large rectus sheath hematoma. She simultaneously developed oozing at all line sites with resulting ecchymoses (ultrasound of the groin revealed no hematoma). Over the ensuing 2-3 days, she received 12 units of pRBCs, 10 units of FFP, 5 units of platelets, and 4 units of cryoprecipiate. She was also treated with DDAVP x 2 days. Her blood counts ultimately stabilized at prior baseline values.  # Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension to SBPs 70s-80s after initiation of CVVH. She ultimately required pressors to support her blood pressure, and an A-line was placed for closer monitoring. She was able to be weaned from pressors shortly prior to extubation and blood pressures remained stable until transfer to the floor.  # Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated WBC count during most of her hospital stay. This may have been partially due to therapy with prednisone, but given differential with > 90% PMNs and low grade bandemia, likely represented infection. She was treated for presumed HCAP with vanco\/Zosyn but rising WBC count persisted. C. difficile was negative x 3, and urine showed persistent yeast despite 5-day treatment course of fluconazole, though this was in the setting of very low UOP. Final culture results were negative.  # ETOH dependence with h\/o DTs. Placed on CIWA. Continued thiamine, folate, MVI.   FLOOR COURSE [**2147-5-7**] - DISCHARGE:  # ETOH hepatitis\/EtOH Cirrhosis - Pt's bilirubin slowly decreased and stabilized at 14-16 with overall trend down from peak of 31.9 on [**4-22**]. Pt was also noted to be [**Doctor First Name **] positive (1:320) and AMA positive (1:20) but liver biopsy was not c\/w autoimmune hepatitis.  TTG-IgA negative. EGD [**5-16**] normal s\/p gastric bypass, without varices. Pt's prednisone (started 40mg daily on [**4-24**] in the ICU) was continued and tapered as per discharge medications (end [**2147-6-8**]). Rifaximin and lactulose were continued. She did not get nadolol given low BPs and lack of varices on EGD. She received nutritional support with tube feeds until the Dobhoff came out after her endoscopy. She had extensive nutrion counseling to maintain her calorie and protein intake in balance with her diet for her gastric bypass.  # Acute renal failure, now with chronic kidney disease: [**2-14**] ATN from hypotention and DIC. Pt was on CVVH, now on HD. She began to make small amounts of urine (300-500cc\/day). Per renal, there is possible slow recovery but at this time, it seems less likely and she will require long term dialysis. Her electrolytes and volume status remained stable. PPD negative (0 mm). Tunneled line placed [**5-19**] for outpatient dialysis (will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9419**]. Epo will be given with dialysis. She is at high risk for osteoporosis. PTH 67 (high-normal). Vitamin D will be givein with dialysis. Renal did not recommend calcium supplementation and her Ca levels will be monitored with HD. Vitamin D level is pending at discharge. She will require bone density testing as outpatient to determine baseline, which can be arranged by her PCP.  #Anemia - Pt with slowly decreasing Hct during her floor stay, requiring occassional transfusions. Her DIC had resolved and there was no evidence of recurrence. She had EGD that was unremarkable and her stools were consistently guaiac negative. Iron studies demonstrated underlying anemia of chronic disease and marrow supression likely from acute illness and renal failure. B12 and folate normal. Haptoglobin was low concerning for hemolysis, although reticulocyte count low and Direct bili trending down rather than up. Indirect bili likely elevated [**2-14**] liver disease. Pt was started on epogen with dialysis. She will require Hct checks as outpatient. Hct on discharge was 26.7.  # h\/o HTN - As above, pt was hypotensive requiring pressors in the ICU. She remained low-normotensive on the floor. Her home atenolol was stopped.  # Leukocytosis: By arrival to the floor, pt had completed 8 day course of abx for VAP and 5 day fluconazole course for fungal UTI as above. C diff neg x6 (last three sent recently given persistent leukocytosis), stool cultures negative, sputum only with sparse yeast. She did not have paracentesis due to minimal ascites. L LENI negative for DVT. Repeat UA negative. Her WBC trended down in setting of resolving acute alcoholic hepatitis and taper of steroids. WBC [**12-25**] at discharge was likely due to prednisone.  # Epigastric pain - Likely indigestion. Improved with maalox. Exam unremarkable and abdomen nontender. It is not associated with food and amylase\/lipase normal making pancreatitis less likely. It improves with ambulation, so unlikely to be cardiac and EKG during episodes were unchanged from prior.  # Loose stools - Pt had frequent loose stools, most likely in setting of antibiotics received in ICU. All stool cultures and C diff negative. Her stools became more formed and her lactulose was resumed at 15mL daily.  # ETOH abuse - Pt had discussions with medical team and social work and understood the consequences of continued use. She was continued on thiamine. Folate and MVI included in nephrocaps. Pt will require close follow up for relapse prevention. Her boyfriend [**Name (NI) **] is a good source of support.  # Depression - Pt was on zoloft on admission, which was held because all SSRIs are hepatically cleared. Pt has h\/o recent suicide attempt. Zoloft 50mg daily restarted [**5-20**] and can be uptitrated as outpatient. Her mood remained stable during her hospitalization.  "}]
