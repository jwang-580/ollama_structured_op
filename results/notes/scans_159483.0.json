IMAGING CT abdomen\/pelvis with contrast [**2139-7-6**] Large amount of pelvic ascites is present. The rectum and sigmoid colon appear grossly unremarkable. The bladder is also unremarkable. Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  IMPRESSION: 1. Advanced infiltrate of hepatocellular carcinoma with probable occlusion of the right portal vein as described on previous CT. New interval increase in large volume ascites likely indicates disease progression. 2. Diffuse hyperenhancement of the small and large bowel likely related to occlusion of the portal system. Lack of progression of oral contrast material beyond the stomach despite two-hour interval of administration. There is no definite obstruction as there are no dilated loops of small bowel or air-fluid levels. NG tube terminates within the stomach. 3. No definite free intraperitoneal air. . CXR [**2139-7-5**] FINDINGS: The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. The lungs are clear. The visualized osseous structures appear within normal limits. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of free air. . KUB [**2139-7-6**] No gross evidence of change. Contrast now in the colon thus no obstruction. No supine evidence of free air. . EGD [**2139-7-6**] Findings: Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The varices were not bleeding. 4 bands were successfully placed. Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the whole stomach. These findings are compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Small ammout of dark blood was seen in the stomach. Duodenum:  Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted. *Impression*: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus (ligation) Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with mild portal hypertensive gastropathy -Normal mucosa in the duodenum -Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum . ------------------ CT Torso [**2139-6-8**] CT Chest Thyroid and thoracic inlet appear unremarkable. Paraseptal blebs are present. No discrete metastases of note. . CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. There is a massive confluent infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma . This has substantially increased in size, and now involves the entire liver. Ascites is now present. This is a new finding. Focal areas of Ethiodol uptake are identified within the more central necrotic parts of this tumor. Aneurysmal dilatation of the left portal vein. Hepatic right portal vein appears occluded. The hepatic veins appear patent, although parts of the middle hepatic vein are grossly attenuated. Enlargement and recruitment of the hepatic artery is seen. There is infiltration into the anterior omentum, which may represent tumor spread. No definite metastatic disease is seen. . CT PELVIS Ascites as before. Prostate is normal. Bladder appears normal. Large and small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. . CT BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion. There are degenerative changes, possibly represent old trauma, along the right inferior pubic ramus. CONCLUSION: Massive disease progression with right portal vein and possibly middle hepatic veins are occluded. No definitive extra-hepatic spread. .   "}]
