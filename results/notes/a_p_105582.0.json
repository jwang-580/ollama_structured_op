[{"0":" # Cardiogenic shock: Patient admitted with cardiogenic shock. Work up for causes was unremarkable, including Cath revealing clean coronaries, HIV, Iron studies, RF, [**Doctor First Name **] and TSH. EF is depressed globally without regional wall motion abnls and improved on IABP. TTE showed mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). Restrictive left ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe diastolic dysfunction. RV is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. Mild PA htn. TTE also showed 3+ MR, but it was unknown how much this complicated patient's Cardiogenic shock picture. A repeat TTE on [**7-14**] showed minimal improvement in EF on IABP and unchanged MR. In addition, patient was admitted in A flutter and it was felt that this rhythm disturbance on top of an already compromised EF caused the patient to go into cardiogenic shock. Patient was initially managed on Milrinone and Dopamine, but an IABP was placed during patient's cardiac catheterization. Milrinone was eventually weaned off and replaced by afterload reduction by ace inhibitors, which were slowly titrated up and eventually, the patient's IABP was able to be removed on [**2124-7-19**].  He was also re-started on B-blocker therapy given his stable hemodynamics after removal of the IABP.  Given his massive total body volume overload, the patient was agressively diuresed with a lasix drip while in the CCU and managed to diurese several liters, however, after less than 24 hours on the lasix drip the patient developed a total body pruritic maculopapular rash concerning for a drug rash. Given that lasix had been recently increased, it was suspected that lasix was related to the rash and was discontinued.  The patient was switched to oral Ethacrynic acid instead, as it contains no sulfa moiety in case this was contributing to the patient's rash.  The patient responded well to oral Ethacrynic acid, and was able to be volume net negative on 50mg daily. . # Coronaries: Cardiac biomarkers were flat when cycled. Cardiac catheterization revealed clean coronaries. Patient was continued on [**Date Range **] while in house. . # Cardiac Rhythm: On admission, the patient was in atrial flutter.  Per the patient, he had no prior history of AFib or Flutter.  During his hospitalization, he was transiently in sinus rhythm after cardioversion in the OR on HD #2, but sinus rhythm was not maintained throughout the hospitalization. Patient was given a bolus of Amiodarone and eventually started on Digoxin for rate control.  In addition, after recovery from cardiogenic shock, the patient was placed on a beta-blocker, but despite this remained in paroxysmal atrial flutter throughout this hospitalization.  The patient was started on anti-coagulation with coumadin and heparin during this hospitalization given his paroxysmal AF, and PVD, as below. . # PVD:  While in the CCU with an IABP the patient was noted to have bilateral cool lower extremeties that appeared somewhat cyanotic and mottled appearing.  The patient's circulation to his lower extremeties improved after removal of the IABP. Vascular surgery was consulted and felt that the patient may have been showering emboli given his significant PVD, and would most likely benefit from being on anti-coagulation with coumadin for at least the next few months. . # Respiratory failure: On HD#2, patient was intubated via nasal airway in the setting of planned cardioversion. He self-extubated on [**2124-7-13**] and did not require re-intubation with no further episodes of respiratory distress this hospitalization. . # Acute renal failure: Felt to be due to ATN in the setting of shock. Cr gradually improved back to 1.1 at time of discharge while on a stable diuretic regimen. . # ID: Patient spiked multiple fevers over the course of his first week in the hospital. He was initially covered broadly with vancomycin and zosyn given initial concern for sepsis. Culture data remained negative and lines were removed without growth of bacteria. Antibiotics were stopped on [**2124-7-16**] and patient did not respike a temperature. In the setting of Tube feeds, patient had some diarrhea but initial C diff toxins were negative. On [**7-17**] the patient's stool was positive for C Diff and he was started on a 14 day course of Metronidazole for treatment. . # Rash: The patient developed a total body rash as described above, felt to be a drug rash with lasix as the likely offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  He recieved Benadryl, Sarna lotion, and topical hydrocortisone cream with some improvement in his pruritis.  The rash stopped progressing after discontinuation of the lasix and switching to ethacrynic acid as above. . # Depression: The patient's home dose of Seroquel and Fluvoxamine were continued throughout his hospitalization. . # Transaminitis: Suspect most likely due to shock liver in the setting of cardiogenic shock. The patient's transaminases improved without intervention. A liver consult was initially requested in case a heart transplant was necessary, and it was deemed that the patient does not have cirrhosis advanced enough to interfere with such a procedure should it become necessary.
