[{"0":" 1. Hypotension: Pt originally admitted to the ICU given episode of hypotension to the 80s. Given the patient's initial presentation, she did not meet SIRS criteria given her WBC, temp, RR, HR. Determined not to be septic shock.  On review of her clinical notes her BP appears to be 95 in her prior Primary Care visit, there is also a comment in a prior Neurology note of possible dysautonomia from her thoracic lesion. Patient had stable SBPs 80-90s with no evidence of end-organ ischemia, mentating well, good urine output, during her hospitalization, so was presumed to be at baseline and secondary to autonomic dysfunction. Did not require IVF boluses and remained hemodynamically stable. . 2. Hypoxia: Pt noted to be hypoxic at home on room air that corrected with 2L of oxygen. Given CXR LLL\/retrocardiac infiltrate lobar pneumonia was thought to be the cause of the patient's hypoxia.  She was treated empirically for HAP with levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Given sputum culture grew sparse growth of staph aureus, the patient was continued on this regimen, vancomycin for 7 days, levofloxacin for 10 days. Ipratropium\/Albuterol nebs treatments, chest PT, acapella and incentive spirometer use improved the patient's symptoms. . 3.  UTI: Pt also has history of frequent UTIs given that her caregiver self-caths. She was started on Augmentin for [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**] Klebsiella UTI diagnosed in Caritas. Her review of urine culture data shows [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**] Klebsiella sensitive to Zosyn, Meropenem, Bactrim, Unasyn. She also has a h.o. of Proteus sensitive to Zosyn. Though [**Last Name (STitle) 40097**] Klebsiella appears to be sensitive to Zosyn there may be a difference between in-[**Last Name (un) **] vs in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] sensitivity.  High rate of resistance with [**Last Name (un) 40097**] during Zosyn therapy, thus was initially treated with Meropenem.  When the culture data returned with pansensitive pseudomonas, Meropenem was discontinued and levofloxacin was continued for total of 10 days. . 4.  Thrombocytopenia: Pt on admission noted to have plt 130, prior baseline has shown plt count in the 300s.  The patient's platelet count dropped to 84 on her third hospital day.  Heparin and omeprazole were discontinued as possible causes.  Her count returned to 144 prior to discharge.  Omeprazole was held, and the patient instructed to have a repeat platelet count as an outpatient. . 5. T1-T2 paraplegia s\/p MVC: Pt was maintained on her home regimen of Methadone, Lyrica, Baclofen, Lidocaine patch, Klonopin, Trazadone.  Home oxycodone was discontinued given hypotension and questionable mental status at times.  The patient never requested oxycodone therapy.  She was asked to refrain from restarting oxycodone as an outpatient if possible.  . 6.  h.o. PRES syndrome: Pt has history of PRES syndrome occured in [**12\/2147**] and thought to be due to a combination of pressors, pt's underlying labile BP.  The patient's blood pressure remained relatively stable during hospitalization, with increases when the patient was anxious. . 7. Hypothyroidism: Continued home regimen of levothyroxine.   "}]
