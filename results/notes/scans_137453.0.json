[{"0":" ***** [**4-23**] OPERATIVE REPORT: Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **] Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 98484**] Service:  [**Last Name (un) **] Date:  [**2153-4-23**] Date of Birth:  [**2090-6-19**] Sex:  M Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1286**], MD 2178  FIRST ASSISTANT:  [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], INT  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Chronic cholecystitis with cholecystostomy tube in     place. 2. Large incarcerated umbilical hernia.  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Same.  OPERATION: 1. Attempted laparoscopy, conversion to open. 2. Open cholecystectomy. 3. Repair of incarcerated umbilical hernia.  ANESTHESIA:  General.  INDICATION:  This patient with quite marked coronary disease and chronic atrial fibrillation was taken off his anticoagulants 5 days prior to surgery and brought to the operating room to deal with chronic cholecystitis which was a result of having had a cholecystostomy tube in place when he developed severe cholecystitis and cholangitis and required an intensive care unit stay some 6 or 8 weeks ago. He also had a large incarcerated umbilical hernia. The goal was to try and perform this operation laparoscopically and then repair the umbilical hernia but this turned out to be impossible.  TECHNIQUE:  We placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24631**] cannula through the upper part of the umbilical hernia after entering the peritoneal cavity, and upon inflating the abdomen it was quite clear that this was not going to be a laparoscopic operation and we therefore made a midline incision.  FINDINGS:  The patient had extensive adhesions around the gallbladder, between the gallbladder and the liver and between the liver and the abdominal wall. The cystic duct and cystic artery were eventually well-seen. The gallbladder contained multiple small stones and the back of the gallbladder wall had to be left on the liver as there was simply no plane to carry out the dissection. This operation was therefore much more prolonged than normal (at least 75% longer and more complicated). Additionally, the umbilical hernia itself required a substantial dissection to repair it.  TECHNIQUE:  The gallbladder was first of all visualized after dissecting off for the surrounding adhesions and then it was aspirated of green bile. An attempt was then made to take it down from the fundus towards the cystic-common duct junction but there was simply no plane. We entered the gallbladder, therefore, and left the posterior wall of the gallbladder on the liver bed as we came down towards the neck of the gallbladder. At this point, I identified the cystic duct node and adjacent to it came across the cystic artery. This was therefore doubly clipped. We then proceeded millimeter by millimeter to identify the cystic duct which was done. It was clipped twice and the gallbladder was then removed. As I stated, the back wall of the gallbladder was left on the liver bed as there was simply no plane from all the chronic inflammation. With the gallbladder removed, we carried out a careful check for hemostasis, and we then turned our attention to the umbilical hernia. The midline incision was extended to this area and the incarcerated tissue was reduced and partially excised. The skin of the umbilicus had been so stretched out by the size of this hernia that it too was removed and the patient will have no umbilical skin component. The edges were identified of the fascia and freed up circumferentially.  We then closed the entire incision with #1 PDS and staples to the skin. The patient tolerated procedure well and was returned to the recovery room.  ***** [**4-25**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial mass\/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-27**], the findings are similar  ***** [**4-27**] CT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS: IMPRESSION:  1. Large hematoma extending from the gallbladder fossa inferiorly. High density within the upper portion of the hematoma likely represents more acute bleeding. Active extravasation cannot be assessed without IV contrast.  2. Second pocket of fluid anterior to the left lobe of the liver containing air pockets and heterogeneous fluid, likely postoperative sequelae, but possibly communicating with the large hematoma in the gallbladder fossa.  3. Bilateral pleural effusions and lung base airspace opacities which could represent extensive atelectasis. Other considerations include aspiration or pneumonia.  4. Unchanged appearance of enlarged kidneys with perinephric stranding, consistent with renal disease as discussed on recent ultrasound examinations.  5. Stable appearance of calcified splenic lesion.
