[{"0":" 1. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer: not surgical candidate. Has gastric outlet obstruction related to tumor. Failed duodenal stenting X 2.  Considered G-\/G-J tube placement, but was not clinically stable enough to tolerate procedure.  Given rapid progression of disease, he was no longer considered able to tolerate Cyberknife. Palliative external beam radiation was considered.  He ultimately required NG placement and constant suction because of nausea and vomiting.  After discussions with the family, given his rapid decompensation, goals were changed to symptom management and transition to hospice.  2. Hypotension\/hypoxia: He developed a GI bleed related to the stent leading to hypotension which responded to IV fluid and blood transfusion.

Hypernatremia\/Nutrition: unable to tolerate food due to gastric outlet obstruction. Given TPN, however, this was discontinued once his central line was removed.
