[{"0":" 82yo M with h\/o Afib on Coumadin, dCHF, CRI, and s\/p recent EGD on [**2115-9-11**] showing erosive gastritis with some coffee grounds, polypectomy of 2 polyps at hepatic flexure, and diverticulosis in sigmoid colon, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with significant amount of bleeding per GI tract. Was admitted to unit and resuscitated with blood products, 9U PRBC's and 4U FFP, and s\/p tagged RBC scan showing bleeding at hepatic flexure (at site of previous GI procedure), unsuccessful angiography, and s\/p repeat colonscopy with clips applied to ulcers seen at hepatic flexure.  1. GIB--Pt went to unit and resuscitated with blood products, tagged RBC scan showed bleeding at sight of hepatic flexure.  Pt went to IR (after prophylactic Bicarb and Mucomyst) for angiography but no vessel was found for coiling.  By morning bleeding had stopped entirely and he went for colonoscopy which showed two deep ulcers around the site of polypectomy from his prior colonoscopy.  Five clips were placed.  Another polyp was also discovered during the colonoscopy, but clipping was held in the setting of acute GI bleed.  Serial Hct's initially showing some drop which required transfusion of one more U PRBC's which were stopped early due to low grade fever as below. However, pt's vitals stable through continued stay on the floor and Hct finally stabilized and was stable around 28 by the time of d\/c.  Coumadin was held on first admission and continued to be held while pt was admitted. This will need to be addressed at further visits with PCP as pt has high risk for stroke with high CHADS2 score. ASA at 325mg qday was continued.  Pt will also likely need repeat colonoscopy in the future as another polyp at the hepatic flexure was seen that was not removed due to pt already bleeding. We left this to the pt and his PCP to discuss the timing of this.  2. AFib--Pt did not have RVR and did not require rate control though stay. Coumadin was held as above.  3. UTI--While on the floor, the pt began having temperature in low 100's while receiving blood products. Transfusion stopped, and pt continued to spike fevers through the next day, BCx and UCx, CXR done. UCx ended up being positive for pan sensitive Klebsiella, and pt received 2d worth of Fluoroquinolones (first Cipro then Levaquin) and was d\/c'd with 5 day course more of Cipro, renally dosed. The UCx coincided with pt's subjective feeling of increased urination and burning on urination as well. By time of d\/c pt had not had fevers for a couple days and was clinically well. Was never hemodynamically compromised during febrile episodes.  4. dCHF\/HTN--Pt's bp meds were held on amdission and slowly added back until day of discharge when pt was on full home regimen of Clonidine, Felodipine, Lasix, Hydralazine, and Imdur. Pt did not have symptomatic heart failure and did not require diuresis above his home PO regimen except twice for a small amt of increased BLE edema.  5. CAD s\/p distant PTCI--Was not an active issue during this admission and didn't have CP. CE enzymes negative x2. No evidence of ischmia on EKG. ASA was restarted without incident. Continued home simvastatin  6. CRI--Pt's baseline 1.5-1.7. Got IVF's, bicarb and Mucomyst for angio procedure and Cr was stable and within baseline through rest of admission. By d\/c was 1.5.  7. H\/o Gout--Wasn't active issue, continued home Allopurinol.   "}]
