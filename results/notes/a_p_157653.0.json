[{"0":" Patient was admitted with an aspiration pneumonia, with a left lower lobe infiltrate seen on CXR. He was initially admitted to the ICU where he was given levofloxacin and cefepime. He also received one dose of steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation while in the emergency room, and this was discontinued. His fever curve improved, and he was switched to levofloxacin alone to complete a total 10 day course as an outpatient. On day of discharge, he had a leukocytosis, which was improving, and thought from the high dose steroids received in the emergency room, which needs to be followed up with a repeat CBC as an outpatient. His ambulatory oxygen saturation was 88%, and he was 95% on RA at rest. He was continued on his home inhalers.  He was also noted to have acute renal failure, thought to be from both prerenal azotemia and recent indomethacin use. He was advised to hold indomethacin and colchicine. His creatinine returned to baseline at day of discharge.  He was also noted to have an anemia with a hematocrit of 33, which was stable. He did not have any signs of bleeding. He will need to have this repeated as an outpatient as well. It is likely anemia of chronic disease.  For his history of alcohol abuse, he was placed on a CIWA scale, and was given a multivitamin, thiamine, and folate. He was counseled on alcohol cessation.  An appointment with his PCP was made. He will need to have a CBC checked at this time.   "}]
