Cardiology Report\tCardiac Cath\tStudy Date of [**2183-1-10**] COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel disease. The LMCA, LCx and RCA were normal. The LAD had an 80% calcified stenosis after S1. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 16 mm Hg and LVEDP of 16 mm Hg. There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP of 49 mm Hg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.1 l\/min\/m2. There was moderate systemic arterial hypertension with SBP of 146 mm Hg and DBP of 73 mm Hg. 3. Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation. The LVEF was calculated to be 60% with anteroapical hypokinesis. 4. Successful PTCA, rotational atherectomy, and placement of a 2.75x15mm Vision bare-metal stent in the mid RCA were performed.  Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and a 5% residual stenosis.  (See PTCA comments.) 5. The right common femoral arteriotomy was successfully closed using a 6 Fr Angioseal VIP device.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Placement of a bare metal stent in the mid LAD. .  Cardiology Report\tECG\tStudy Date of [**2183-1-7**]  6:32:36 PM  Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Prolonged QTc interval.

Radiology Report\tCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\tStudy Date of [**2183-1-7**] 7:27 PM Heart is moderately enlarged, mediastinal veins are engorged suggesting elevated central venous pressure. Large area of heterogeneous opacification in the left perihilar and lower lung is most likely pneumonia or large region of pulmonary hemorrhage. Suggestion of lucencies raises questions about cavitation or preexisting cavitated nodules. Right lung is grossly clear, but anatomic detail is obscured by respiratory motion. Right subclavian line tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.  "}]
