No reconstructions were available. No formal report was provided.  FINDINGS:  Within the brain parenchyma, there is global parenchymal atrophy, indicated by enlargement of the ventricles and sulci. There is also periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, consistent with small vessel ischemic disease. A right cerebellar lacunar infarct is also noted. There is no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. There is no shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved.  There is a large destructive lesion involving the vertex of the calvarium. There is no underlying brain mass lesion or brain abscess, although there is an extra- axial, likely subdural, soft tissue\/fluid component to this lesion, although this is difficult to evaluate due to volume averaging at the vertex and the lack of reconstructions. The lesion at the vertex causes significant osseous destruction. There is subcutaneous gas, which also extends intracranially, with resultant pneumocephalus.  IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive destructive lesion involving the calvarial vertex, with intracranial extension indicated by pneumocephalus and extra-axial, intracranial soft tissue\/fluid component. This does not appear to be of primary CNS etiology. Differential includes infectious process or a subcutaneous or osseous malignancy. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.  2. Small vessel ischemic disease, lacunar infarcts, and global parenchymal atrophy. There are no brain mass lesions or brain abscesses identified.  Renal ultrasound [**2163-6-7**]: FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 9 cm in length. There is no left-sided hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 9.5 cm in length. There is moderate right-sided hydronephrosis. There is no renal mass or stone. There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass, which cannot be further characterized. Bladder is not visualized.  IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis. 2. Non-specific, large cystic pelvic mass.   "}]
