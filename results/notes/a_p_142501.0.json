[**2146-5-23**] . [**2146-5-22**]   Cardiac Arrest: The patient was found \"blue\" and unresponsive by son. CPR was initiated and EMS arrived within 5 minutes. Patient was found by EMS apneic and pulseless and in VFib. Shocked at 200J x 1 --> asystole --> shock 200J times one --> narrow complex tach with pulses. 100mg Lidocaine bolus given followed by Lido drip. Taken to [**Hospital3 **], where he recd Etomidate drip, Succinilcholine, Ativan, Nitro drip, rectal ASA. Patient was intubated after multiple attempts, failed intubation in field.  On arrival to the ED, HR 107 BP 154\/90 RR16 100%, intubated. ECG showed no ST segment elevations but atrial fibrillation, LVH and diffuse non-specific ST segment depressions. Pt was given 20.5mg Integrilin bolus followed by 113.6mcg\/min, Heparin drip, Lidocaine 2mg\/min drip, Plavix 600mg and Metoprolol 10mg IV.  He was transferred to the CCU and continued on heparin gtt and integrilin. Je was initated on the hypothermia protocol to gaurd against cerebral reperfusion injusry for 24hrs. The patient eventually converted to sinus rhythm and HR slowed to 40s. Per review of literature, this is normal for patient's undergoing cooling.  The patient was evaluated by neurology who initatied continuous EEG monitoring.  He also had a CT-head that showed no intracranial hemorrhage.  The patient completed 24hrs of cooling.  The EEG showed no cortical activity and neuro exam revealed little\/no brainstem relfexes.  A family meeting was arranged and given his poor prognosis for meaningful recovery the family made the patient CMO.  He was extubated and placed on a morphine gtt. The patient passed on [**2146-5-26**] at 5:15am.   "}]
