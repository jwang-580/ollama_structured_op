[{"0":" 61 y\/o female with severe COPD and frequent flares who presents with dyspnea, admitted to MICU for respiratory distress. . The patient was given levalbuterol nebs and solumedrol IV to treat her COPD. She was intubated for hypoxia. In addition, she was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone to treat a suspected pulmonary infection, which might have triggered her COPD flare. She then had ceftriaxone discontinued, and was extubated two days later.  She did well with decreasing need for nebulizers. In the morning, she was 100% on 4L NC; she is on 2L NC at home. She was gradually weaned down on her oxygen. Patient was initially given solumedrol 125 mg IV every 8 hours, and was tapered down to prednisone 10 mg daily, which is her home dose. She was given Atrovent nebulizers. Her sputum cultures were negative. She then developed altered mental status and agitation requiring quetiapine and haloperidol, which was attributed to steroid psychosis and which improved with tapering of her steroid dose. Her QT was prolonged to 490, which remained stable with her antipsychotics. She was monitored on telemetry. She was in restraints at times for her psychosis, but did not require them in the 24 hours prior to discharge. . She was initially ruled out for an MI in the setting of her shortness of breath, with three negative sets of enzymes and a CXR which did not suggest heart failure. Her EKG was unchanged. She was continued on her aspirin and Plavix and her other cardioprotective medications. She was tachycardic and hypertensive while in respiratory distress, but this improved with improvement in her breathing. . Her creatinine was slightly elevated on admission to 0.9, which improved with hydration. .
