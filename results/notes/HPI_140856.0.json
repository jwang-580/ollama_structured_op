In the remote past she had undergone a Nissen fundoplication with placement of an open gastrostomy tube. She was completely dependent on tube feeding.  She had progressively witnessed widening of her gastrostomy tract until it had become an open fistula with marked breakdown of the surrounding skin. Over the previous 2 months, multiple attempts had been made by the interventional radiology and gastroenterology services to close the opening with noninvasive means including Gelfoam packing. None of these had been successful.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] was to have seen the patient electively to consider surgery, but she instead, entered the hospital via the emergency room with an upper gastrointestinal bleed, with a 10-point decrease her hematocrit requiring transfusion. The effluent through the open gastrostomy was consistent with coffee grounds. She never had bright red blood. She arrived at our hospital on intravenous vancomycin and Zosyn treating an unclear source of presumed infection. She was stated to have a pneumonia, but had a normal chest x-ray and ultimately a normal chest CT scan. We had continued the antibiotics. She had mild elevations of her lipase and amylase which had no correlate on her CT scan. Her gallbladder appeared to be normal, as was the pancreas. In addition, upon arrival she was profoundly dehydrated with a creatinine of 1.9, with a baseline of 0.3. She had been placed on intravenous nutrition 2 months earlier when use of the G-tube was thought to be unwise.  Past Medical History: PMH: Rett syndrome, seizures, osteoporosis, gastrocutaneous fistula PSH: spine surgery, G-tube, s\/p Nissen fundoplication   "}]
