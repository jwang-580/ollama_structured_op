[{"0":" Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year old female with history of hypertension and sarcoidosis, recently started on prednisone therapy for sarcoidosis, who was found to be hyperglycemic, admitted to ICU with HHNK . #) Hyperglycemia, Diabetes Mellitus II, uncontrolled, with complications: At triage, her finger stick was critically high. She did not appear to have any evidence of acidosis. Her serum osmolality was elevated at time of arrival at 325 mOsm. Given lack of ketones in her urine, this all suggested hyperosmolar non-ketonic state, without evidence of DKA. Prior to this she had no known history of diabetes mellitus or glucose impairment. The hyperglycemia may all be related to her steroids or could also represent unmasking of type two diabetes mellitus (HgA1c 7.9). CXR without clear infectious etiology, UA negative, no other suggestion of infection as precipitating factor by history.  The pt was initially on insulin gtt, and this was discontinued and the pt was covered with sliding scale insulin and glargine. The pt then had a dietary indiscretion (Chinese food) and insulin gtt was restarted. On transfer to General medicine, blood glucoses were in 300's requiring sliding scale coverage. The pt also continued to complain of blurry vision which was thought to be secondary to her hyperglycemia.  [**Last Name (un) **] consulted, Was started on lantus 10U qam, metformin started\/increased to 1000\/500 (will need to monitor LFTs given underlying cholestatic liver disease). Given her fingersticks were noted to peak midday, typical of prednisone, [**Last Name (un) **] recommended NPH 25 U in the morning (instead of lantus) and adding glucotrol as well.  On discharge, she was on NPH 25 U in the AM, metformin, and glucotrol. She was given diabetes teaching by nutrition and nursing, and was asked to call [**Last Name (un) **] after discharge to arrange a follow up appointment. She was also asked to check her fingersticks 4 times a day and discuss reads with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will see her PCP 4 days after discharge. . #) Acute renal failure: The pt's ARF resolved with IV fluid rescuscitation. . #) Anion gap\/Osmolar gap: Suspect that this was in large part due to renal failure and dehydration. Ketones were negative. . #) Hyponatremia: Corrected sodium level on presentation was actually 134.7. This resolved with normalization of hyperglycemia. . #) Sarcoidosis: Patient was started on prednisone 60 mg daily about 2 weeks ago for treatment. During this admission the pt was continued on 20mg po prednisone, with plans to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**] her pulmonologist to discuss other possible treatment options. Fluticasone spray stopped while on prednisone, esp since pt has thrush. on bactrim MWF, prilosec, ca+vit D [**Hospital1 **] for proph. . #) Hypertension: BP meds initially held in setting of ARF and volume depletion.  lisinopril resumed at 40 mg daily;  BP low\/normal on discharge (better diet while here), norvasc and hctz not resumed. . #) Thrush: Treated with Nistatin swish and swallow, suspect this is secondary to steroid use and concurrent hyperglycemia . #) Blurry vision: Suspect this was setting of hyperglycemia, as she has no known history of eye involvement of sarcoid. Visual acuity as noted in ED, fundoscopic exam without gross abnormalities. Improved but still a bit blurry by time of discharge. No eye pain or redness to suggest acute angle closure glaucoma or other acute process. Instructed to f\/u ophtho ASAP if does not improve in next few days, and needs regular f\/u as well for DM . #) Chest discomfort: Patient has a history of left-sided chest pain that has been evaluated by her PCP and was felt to be costochrondritis in the past. No convincing ischemic changes on EKG and CE were negative for ACS. . #) Left arm pain: Pt complained of a tingling sensation in her left arm extending from the palm of her hand to her elbow. She stated that this pain started after a painful IV attempt in the ICU in which she felt tingling in her arm afterwards. On examination, this seemed to be consistent with trauma of one of her nerves, so tylenol\/heat packs recommended. Discussed that if she had some injury to her nerve this may take several weeks to heal.    "}]
