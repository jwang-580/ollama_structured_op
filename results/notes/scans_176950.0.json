Left atrial enlargement. Low limb lead voltage. Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2134-10-6**] the rate has increased. There is variation in precordial lead placement. The previously recorded early precordial R wave transition is no longer in evidence. There are now Q waves in leads V1-V2 consistent with interim anteroseptal infarction. The limb lead voltage has diminished. The rate has increased and there are ST-T wave changes. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.  Cardiac Catheterization [**2143-2-4**]:  1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel disease with an acute proximal LAD lesion.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The LAD had an acute lesion of 99% stenosis in the proximal segment.  The first diagonal had 80% stenosis.  The LCX had 40% hazy stenosis at the mid segment.  The RCA was chronically totally occluded at the proximal segment and was filled by left to right collaterals. 2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated right sided filling pressures (RVEDP 26 mm Hg) and markedly elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 25 mm Hg).  There was mild PA hypertension (PA 40\/27 mm Hg). 3. 4.  Stenting of very proximal LAD with Cypher 3x18mm stent posted to 3.25mm in setting of STEMI. 5.  IABP inserted for cardiogenic shock.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.  PTCA of  vessel.  Transthoracic Echo [**2143-2-4**]:  The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the septum. The anterior wall may be hypokinetic also. The inferolateral wall may be slightly hypokinetic but suboptimal image quality limits certainty. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.  IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with moderate to severe septal hypokinesis. The anterior wall is probably hypokinetic but is not well seen. The RV is dilated and probably hypokinetic but image quality limits interpretation. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Large anterior fat pad.   "}]
