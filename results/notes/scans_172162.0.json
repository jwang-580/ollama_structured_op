A left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained.  Blood flow images show a small active bleed in the right lower quadrant.  Dynamic blood pool images show a small active bleed in the right hepatic flexure  IMPRESSION: Small active right hepatic fexture gastrointestinal bleed.  [**2115-9-20**] mesenteric angiography PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks, benefits and alternatives of the proposed procedure were thoroughly explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed. After local anesthesia with 10 mL of 1% lidocaine, access was gained into the right common femoral artery with a 19-gauge needle. A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] guide wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta. The needle was removed and a 5 French sheath was inserted. The sheath was connected to a continuous side arm flush. A 5 French C2 catheter was then placed through the sheath over the wire into the right common femoral artery with the tip ending in the abdominal aorta. The [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then removed. The C2 catheter was lodged into the superior mesenteric artery. Arteriogram of the superior mesenteric artery taken in multiple projections was recorded digitally and showed no active bleeding site or vascular abnormalities involving branches of the ileocolic, right colic or middle colic arteries. The [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then placed through the C2 catheter and the catheter was then removed over the wire. A 5 French SOS catheter was then placed over the wire into the right common femoral artery and further advanced into the aorta and formed in the thoracic aorta. The wire was then removed. The SOS catheter was then used to selectively catheterize the inferior mesenteric artery. Arteriogram of the inferior mesenteric artery did not show any active bleeding site or other vascular abnormalities at the branches of the left colic artery, sigmoid branches, and superior rectal arteries. The C2 catheter was then removed. The sheath at the right groin was removed and hemostasis was achieved by manual compression of the right groin site for 15 minutes. A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.  IMPRESSION: Mesenteric arteriogram of the SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] did not show any active bleeding or vascular abnormalities. If the patient continues lower GI bleeding, a repeat superselective arteriogram of the ileocolic and right colic and middle colic arteries could be repeated with possible transcatheter embolization.  [**2115-9-24**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous chest radiograph of [**2115-8-20**], the multifocal pneumonia has almost completely resolved with subtle residual airspace opacities in the right lower lung. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged. Calcification in the thoracic aorta is stable, degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine are moderate to severe.  IMPRESSION:  Resolving multifocal infection with persistent subtle airspace opacities in the right lower lobe   "}]
