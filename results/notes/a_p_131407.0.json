[{"0":" This is a 62 yo M with past medical history of kidney transplant in [**Country 651**] 3 years ago who has been in the US for the last 4 months and had been experiencing intermittent fevers to 102 without source for the last week. He was at [**Hospital1 **] for these fevers for the last 3 days without a diagnosis and continued to experience fevers at home. At [**Hospital1 **], he was given Zosyn without improvement and left AMA. He then presented to the [**Hospital1 **] ED for further evaluation.  In the ED, initial VS were 99.2 101 18 136\/83 97% on RA. His blood work revealed a lactate of 7.5, an LDH of 2635 and an AG acidosis. He also had a leukocytosis with left shift. He spiked a fever to 102.6 and was given tylenol 1 gm, vanc\/cefepime given concern for fever in the setting of immunocomprise. He rec'd a total of 4L of NS. His lactate came down to 5.4. He was HD throughout his ED stay, but given his elevated lactate, he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.   With volume resuscitation, his lactate trended down and he was transferred to the floor on [**4-14**].  On the floor, the patient had no complaints other than fatigue. He was accompanied by his son who was translating. He was quite concerned about the function of his transplanted kidney. He did report increased frequency of urination with decrease volume of urine for the last 4 days. No burning with urination. No tenderness over his transplant site. He noted drinking fluid regularly but endorses some decreased PO over the last week due to disintrest. No other complaints.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 2cm, concerning for PTLD v lymphoma. Heme-onc was consulted and recommended excisional lymph node biopsy for diagnosis. The patient wa being followed by renal and ID as well. On the morning of [**4-15**], the patient's lactate began to rise with a worsening acidosis. He was persistently febrile. He also had an episode of hematemesis on the floor with coffee grounds and some bright red blood. He was also noted to be guaiac positive. Cefepime was restarted but his white count and lactate continued to trend up. The patient was transferred back to the ICU for evolving sepsis v rapidly progressive lymphoma.  The source of the patient's elevated lactate was initially unclear, differential included tumor lysis v ischemia.  On [**4-16**], patient had an excisional lymph node biopsy performed with pathology consistent with an aggressive B cell lymphoma.  .........The patient's immunosuppressants were stopped and he was started on high dose steroids.  The patient remained intubated and required 4 pressors to maintain his blood pressure.  He received broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, fluconazole, ivermectin, flagyl and meropenem.  The patient was also started on CVVH and received IV bicard for his profound acidemia.   He also received aggressive fluid resuscitation including both crystalloids and colloid.  On [**4-18**], the patient developed a tachycardia believe to be sinus rhythm with some PAC's.  In the evening of [**4-18**], the patient remained tenuous, he became tachycardiac to the 180s, quickly dropped his blood pressures despite fluid, albumin and bicarb and died with his family at his side.
