[{"0":" Assessment and Plan: This is an 85 y\/o female with right sided heart failure, pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s\/p mechanical MVR, HTN, seizure disorder who presents with fevers, hypotension and altered mental status. . # Goals of care: Patient was made comfort measures only after discussion with family. No escalation of care, DNR. All medications were discontinued except lorazepam and morphine. . # Altered mental status\/seizures\/CNS infection: The patient had a remote history of seizure disorder which had been stable until 2 weeks prior to presentation. The patient had a seizure and was started on keppra, however, her mental status has been declining since that time. The patient developed a fever and worsening of mental status and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for work up. At [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was febrile and was found to be in nonconvulsive status epilepticus. An lumbar puncture at that time was declined by the family. The patient was started empirically on acyclovir, ampicillin, vancomycin and cefepime. Neurology was consulted and discontinued keprra and started dilantin with ativan for breakthrough seizures. The patient also was started on continuous EEG. The option of LP was reevaluated with son and he was agreeable. The patient had a CT head which showed no increased ICP. Her INR was reversed and an LP was performed without complications. HSV PCR was negative so we discontinued acyclovir. The LP was somewhat abnormal without organisms so cefepime, vancomycin and ampicillin were continued for treatment of infectious meningitis for a total course of 14 days. EEG showed that the patient was seizing intermittently and Keppra was added. The EEG showed some improvement with no clinical improvement. Eventually depakote was added. The patient continued to have seizures despite antibiotic treatment, three anticonvulsives and boluses of ativan. Goals of care were discussed with family and the decision was made to make patient CMO. Plans were arranged to transport patient back to rehab facility for comfort care. After discussion with neurology all antiepileptics were discontinued and patient was given standing ativan. . # Infection: The patient presented with SIRS criteria with fevers, leukocytosis. The patient also had mild hypotension. The patient was given IVF to increase MAP. The patient was pan-cultured and initially no LP was done per family wishes. The patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin for coverage. As per above, LP was done which was somewhat abnormal. The patient was started on ampicillin and acyclovir, with acyclovir being discontinued once PCR results returned. Hemodynamic status improved. . # Chronic respiratory failure: The patient presented on a ventilator with a trach. She was continued on her home settings with good oxygenation. ABG's and CXR were done in changes with clinical status, which was stable. . # Afib with RVR: The patient had a history of atrial fibrilation, which continued during her hospitalization. She was continued on anticoagulation with coumadin, which was reversed for her LP. She was then put on a heparin drip until her coumadin was back to goal. Digoxin levels were measured, which were elevated and causing EKG changes. The digoxin was re-added once levels were at appropriate range. The patient initially had her beta blocker held due to hypotension. This was added once her hemodynamics improved. . # EKG changes: The patient presented with lateral ST depression. This was suggestive of demand ischemia vs digoxin toxicity. Her digoxin was held. Aspirin, statin were continued and beta-blockers as tolerated. EKG and CE were trended. . # Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia. She had an acute drop in hct with no obvious sign of bleed. She had a CT of her torso, which showed a hematoma in her thigh but no signs of retroperitoneal bleed. She was transfused pRBC and had serial hct, which were stable throughout the rest of the hospitalization. Hemolysis labs were negative. . # Mechanical valve: The patient was anticoagulated with coumadin or heparin during her stay. . # Diabetes: Continued on insulin sliding scale. . # Acute renal failure: The patient had pre-renal ARF in setting of hypotension. Resolved with fluids. . # FEN: The patient became volume overload secondary to IVF. She was given lasix to diurese.   "}]
