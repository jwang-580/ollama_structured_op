Right lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidation, atelectasis, and likely right pleural effusion. 2. Streaky left basilar retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis and\/or consolidation.  [**2151-11-1**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated\/hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No evidence of PFO\/ASD with agitated saline. Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2143-10-11**], LV function appears hyperdynamic and the right ventricle appears mildly dilated\/hypokinetic. Pulmonary artery systolic pressures could not be determined on the prior study.  [**2151-11-4**] CT SINUS: The patient is intubated. There is mild mucosal thickening of the left maxillary sinus. The right maxillary sinus demonstrates a fluid level. There is opacification of many of the right-sided ethmoid air cells. Aerosolized secretions are noted in left-sided ethmoid air cells. There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells bilaterally. There is near opacification of the sphenoid sinus, with only small foci of air. Frontal sinuses are absent. The ostiomeatal units are patent bilaterally. There is [**Last Name (un) 36826**] type II of the fovea ethmoidalis bilaterally. There may be slight demineralization of the cribiform plate. The sphenoid sinus septum is midline with insertion on the clivus. An impacted canine tooth is noted in the left maxilla. IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus disease as described above with fluid levels and aerosolized secretions. This may represent an acute on chronic sinusitis.  [**2151-11-4**] CT TORSO: 1. Large right basal effusion and small left basal effusion with atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally. The heart is enlarged. Scattered ground-glass opacities seen throughout both lungs, the appearances may represent fluid overload versus infection. 2. 5-mm nodular opacity in the right middle lobe should be followed up with a chest CT in three months if the patient is at increased risk or has prior history of malignancy, otherwise followup chest CT in one year is recommended as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines. 3. Abdominopelvic ascites and fatty liver. 4. No abscess or collection present in the abdomen or pelvis.
