[{"0":" 28 year old female presenting with agitation and tachycardia with known GBL use, presemted with GBL withdrawl. . #. Tachycardia\/agitation: Patient was initially managed in the ICU for airway monitoring\/precautions, and was placed on a CIWA scale, on which she scored infrequently.  Cocaine and opiates were negative on urine tox screen.  Thiamine, magnesium, and folate were given.  TSH was normal.  Seroquel was held. Pt's severe anxiety and significant tachycardia were likely due to significant GBL withdrawl.  She was managed with a CIWA scale, however this did not seem to adequately capture her symptoms of withdrawl, which included anxiety and tachycardia primarily, but also included sweats and occas palpitations.  As pt seems to have significant anxiety at baseline, and pt claimed to be self-medicating for anxiety, Psychiatry was consulted for assistance.  Pt was started on scheduled Valium which was gradually tapered.  Pt had significant improvement in symptoms with scheduled valium, and her withdrawl symptoms gradually decreased.  Her tachycardia appeared to be the most consistent sign of her withdrawl, and at the time of discharge, her tachycardia had resolved.  She was monitored on telemetry throughout the hospitalization. Social work was consulted as well, and between Social Work and Psychiatry, pt was provided extensive resources for Psychiatry and Social Work follow up as an outpatient.  Pt was discharged with 2 additional days of Valium taper. . #.  HCV: diagnosed in [**Month (only) 956**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
