[{"0":" MICU COURSE: # Fevers\/elevated WBC: CXR clear at presentation. Urine clear except for high glucose. Abdomen was soft and non-tender with no rebound at presentation. No signs of RUQ pathology\/cholecystitis on LFTs. History of seizures raised suspicion for CNS infection, although no signs of meningismus on exam; family refused LP to conclusively rule out meningitis. Regardless, patient was treated empirically in first 24 hours with Acyclovir, Vancomycin, Ampicillin, and Ceftriaxone at meningitis dosing. On morning of [**2173-1-21**], culture data and clinical signs remained unrevealing, and with no specific source of infection identified, on [**2173-1-22**], ceftriaxone was stopped as well.  # Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State: Hyperglycemic to 774 at presentation with hypernatremia to 158 (corrected for elevated glc, corrNa was 169). Likely HHS (no ketones in urine, so unlikely DKA). Catalyst is likely infectious process. Hyperglycemia resolved within 12 hours of presentation. Initially treated with insulin gtt, and given his high insulin requirement, D5 1\/2NS as well, and then transitioned to subcutaneous insulin on [**2173-1-21**]. Nutren Pulmonary Full strength tube feedings were started on [**2173-1-22**], at nutrition's recommendation, and although pt had been on nocturnal cycled tube feeds at his nursing home, [**Last Name (un) **] and nutrition consults recommended round the clock tube feedings to simplify blood sugar management. He will therefore receive lantus + RISS for euglycemic control.  # Hypernatremia: Goal was to decrease sodium 12 mEQ in 24 hrs. From evening presentation on [**2173-1-19**] to evening of [**2173-1-20**], sodium went from 158 to 162. On morning of [**2173-1-21**], patient's fluids. He continued to receive tube feeds with Q6H 250 mL free water flushes, and Na was down to 148 on [**2173-1-22**].  # Acute renal failure: Cr was 1.8 on arrival. Likely was prerenal. Creatinine resolved quickly to 0.7 by morning of [**2173-1-21**].  # Hypertension: Antihypertensives held at presentation due to concern for dehydration and impending sepsis, but since he has been stable, on [**1-21**], lisinopril 5mg (home dose was 40mg) and metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **] (was on 100mg [**Hospital1 **] at home).  # Seizure disorder: Has history of seizures and upon admission had seizure in setting of fever and dilantin level of 3.8; not clear when last seizure was. Still unsure if meningitis was present but without LP cannot know this. Reloaded with 500mg dilantin IV x 2 and AM dilantin level on [**2173-1-21**] was supratherapeutic at 28; however, this was not a trough level. A true trough was taken on morning of [**2173-1-22**] and was 13.8.  # Constipation: Patient was without BM from admission to morning of [**2173-1-21**] and had evidence of stool-filled colon on CXR. Lactulose was given on [**2173-1-21**] until patient stooled in the afternoon.  Medicine Floor course: The patient was evaluated by the [**Last Name (un) **] service and his insulin regimen was titrated.  New [**Last Name (un) **] service recs recommended reverting his tube feeds back to his nocturnal tube feeds and titrating his insulin regimen to that schedule.  The patient's lantus was titrated to 10 units qAM with a lispro sliding scale.  The patient will need close further insulin titration on an outpatient basis.  No clear etiology for the patient's fevers and leukocystosis was discovered (family had refused LP). Perhaps there was a viral infection. The patient's bp meds were uptitrated to his home regimen with strict holding parameters on discharge. Would continue prior TF regimen.  "}]
