[{"0":" Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 83882**] is a 53 year old gentleman with past medical history notable for HTN, diabetes mellitus, and recent total hip replacement found unresponsive in his halfway house with rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.  1. Altered Mental Status: The patient presented with altered mental status of unclear etiology.  He was moving all four extremities and hemodynamically stable and afebrile but minimally responsive to commands.  Particularly given his leukocytosis occult infection was a major concern but he remained afebrile, chest radiograph and urinalysis were not consistent with infection, and patient never had meningismus or clinical signs of acute bacterial meningitis.  He received one dose of vancomycin at presentation for unclear reasons.  Blood cultures remained sterile. Toxicology screen was only notable for opiates, which the patient had been prescribed as he recovered from his hip surgery and he had not responded to naloxone on EMS arrival.  There was no osmolar gap and the patient's head CT was essentially benign.  Given acute kidney injury uremia was thought to be a possible cause of encephalopathy and he was dialyzed *1 with rapid improvement of his mental status and increased responsiveness. The patient dramatically improved over the ensuing day and returned to baseline.  He remained with poor memory of the events leading to his presentation but could recall other events and converse in a reasonable manner.  Unfortunately, due to the patient's habitus an initial attempt at an LP was unsuccessful and given his dramatic resolution with dialysis, decreasing leukocytosis, lack of fever, and ability to deny headache it was not considered necessary to reattempt.  Likely cause of somnolence\/delirium at presentation is thought to be uremia though the initial insult that caused patient to be immobile and develop rhabdomyolysis leading to [**Last Name (un) **] and uremia is unclear.  At the time of discharge patient's mental status was at baseline.  * Oliguric Acute Kidney Injury: On presentation the patient had a Cr of 9 up from a baseline reported at 0.8.  Given urinalysis findings of large blood on dipstick without cells and grossly elevated CK most likely etiology was thought to be rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria causing acute kidney injury.  Obstruction and postrenal insult was essentially ruled out by normal ultrasound.  Nephrology was involved in course from the ED where they recommended fluids. The patient eventually put out very poor urine and given this, his metabolic abnormalities (including hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia), and his continued alteration of mental status he had a temporary dialysis catheter placed and received HD *1 with rapid resolution of his metabolic abnormalities and mental status.  Shortly after that he began a brisk diuresis and required no further HD sessions or acute management of electrolyte abnormalities.  Therefore, his HD catheter was removed.  His Cr was down to 1.2 at the time of discharge.  * Rhabdomyolysis At presentation the patient had clear rhabdomyolysis and resulting kidney injury with elevated CK's and urine dipstick with large blood but few RBC's on microscopy suggestive of myoglobinuria.  It was suspected the patient's rhabdomyolysis was secondary to prolonged immobilization in his chair and over his hospitalization he developed skin and tissue breakdown also suggestive of a prolonged immobilization.   The reason for this prolonged immobilization is unclear.  The patient's CK fell with fluids and improvement in his renal function and the last time it was checked it was slightly more than 600.  * Left Foot Vesicle The patient had hyperkeratotic, cracked skin on his feet and was noted to develop a large vesicle on his left lateral sole.  This was evaluated by podiatry who lanced it yielding serous material without frank purulence.  They did not recommend antibiotics and these were not started.  The patient was discharged with outpatient podiatry follow-up.  * Skin Breakdown The patient was noted to have skin breakdown with what looked like a friction ulcer in his gluteal cleft.  This was evaluated by wound care who also noted areas of deep tissue injury and other ulcers on his lower body.  These were thought consistent with a prolonged immobilization with some friction injury from sliding or unintentional movements while unconscious in a chair.  These were all evaluated and showed no signs of acute infection.  Wound care was implemented and the patient will have VNA to help continue this care as an outpatient.  *Hypertension The patient became hypertensive on his second hospital day and thus was restarted on his metoprolol and nifedipine at home doses.  His lisinopril was held given he had acute kidney injury.  As his Cr was close to baseline (down to 1.2) and he was becoming more hypertensive again (SBP's in the 140's) his lisinopril was restarted at half dose (20 mg daily) on the day of discharge.  He will follow up with his PCP to discuss when to increase this back to his standard home dose.  *Diabetes The patient was continued on his home insulin glargine dose as well as insulin sliding scale.  His AC doses and metformin were held in the context of hospitalization and he was given sliding scale with reasonable control of his blood sugars.  His AC humalog and metformin were restarted at discharge.  Given the patient evidenced minimal understanding of his diabetes or its management he received diabetes education in house and was set up to receive more as an outpatient.  As he ran quite hyperglycemic in general it was considered safe to discharge him on his home scheduled insulin regimen with greater understanding required to start sliding scale at home.  * Slightly elevated LFT's: On day of admission patient had elevated LFTs with an ALT 54, AST 81, Alk Phos 148, Tbili 0.5.  Patient had gall stone on abdominal US.  With improvement of mental status patient had benign abdominal exam with no nausea or vomiting.  LFTs were followed and normalized.  Most likely etiology of  * Diabetes Patient has insulin dependent diabetes. He was started on an insulin sliding scale here in the hospital.  An outpatient podiatry appointment was set up for him.  *Hypertensive Cardiomyopathy The patient remained without signs of volume overload or clinical heart failure.  He was continued on his beta blocker and ACEi was restarted prior to discharge.  The patient was kept on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  There was no indication for GI prophylaxis so this was not started.  He was full code.  He tolerated a full diet prior to discharge.   "}]
