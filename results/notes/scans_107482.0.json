Access was via 5 F sheath in Left Femoral artery. Imaging of the distal aorta was deferred as this had been done 3 weeks ago showing a small AAA.  We crossed over into left External iliac with a Omniflush catheter and exchanged for a Straight Glide cath. 2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 126\/47.  There was a moderate gradient from left External iliac to right external iliac sheath with the right being about 8mmHG mean greater.  This is consistent with mild left inflow disease. 3. Imaging of left leg with patent CFA and Profunda.  The SFA had diffuse distal disease with a 3-4cm occlusion.  There was reconstitution at Adductor Canal and 3 vessel run off to foot.  There was a 90% left AT lesion. 4.  Given claudication symptoms with good distal runoff we elected to proceed to intervention.  We exchanged for a 6F [**Last Name (un) **] sheath to left CFA.  We gave heparin and tried to cross the lesion with multiple wires including Angled Glide, Stiff Angled Glide, V-18, and Straight Glide. We were unable to cross and angiography revealed a perforation with extravasation of dye.  At this point further attempts were aborted.  We gave protamine to reverse anticoagulation.  The patient formed a thigh hematoma which was treated with manual pressure on the right CFA and BP control.  She was transferred to CCU for overnight observation.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Unsuccessful attempt at right SFA revascularization.   "}]
