No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is a 1cm mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) with bidirectional flow. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present with normal gradient. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. A well-seated pulmonic valve prosthesis is present. The gradient is high normal. No pulmonary regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Muscular ventricular septal defect with bidirectional flow. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Slightly increased pulmonic bioprosthetic gradient. Normal functioning mitral bioprosthesis.  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2198**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
