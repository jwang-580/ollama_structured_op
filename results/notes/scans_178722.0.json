Delayed precordial R wave progression, possibly a normal variant, possibly anterior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Non-specific inferolateral repolarization changes.  CT Head and C-spine ([**2200-11-24**]): 1. No acute fracture or misalignment of the cervical spine. Multi-level posterior osteophytes which increases risk of spinal cord injury. MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of spinal cord or ligamentous injury. 2. Mild paraseptal likely bullous changes of bilateral lung apices. Miniscule left apical pneumothorax can not excluded. Follow-up suggested. 3. 1.6 cm right thyroid nodule. Ultrasound on a non-emergent basis is suggested.  CXR ([**2200-11-24**]): Severely limited study due to obscuration of the lung apices by the head, otherwise no acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Abd U\/S ([**2200-11-25**]): 1. Stones and debris in the gallbladder. 2. No evidence of stones or hydronephrosis bilaterally.  CT Head w\/o Contrast ([**2200-11-26**]): 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change since the prior study. 2. No soft tissue stranding or any significant abnormalities seen within the subcutaneous tissues to explain etiology of drainage.  Left Foot Radiograph ([**2200-11-29**]): REASON FOR EXAM: Pain in the lateral aspect. There is a question of a fracture in the distal phalanx of the fifth digit.  There is no evidence of dislocation, sclerotic lesions or soft tissue calcifications. There is edema in the soft tissues adjacent to the base of the fifth metatarsal. The fifth metatarsal is normal. There is a small enthesophyte at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.  Chest Radiograph ([**2200-12-1**]) IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar opacities with residual right infrahilar opacity likely due to atelectasis. No definite new source of infection.   "}]
