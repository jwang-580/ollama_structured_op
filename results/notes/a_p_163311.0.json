[{"0":" Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 78932**] was admitted to the MICU for suspected TTp and the need for plasmapheresis.  She was seen by hematology and blood bank for initiation of plasmapheresis.  A pheresis catheter was placed by interventional radiology on the morning of [**2140-7-19**] and she tolerated the procedure well.  Hematology and blood bank both recommended initiation of plasmapheresis given the high suspicion for recurrent TTP.  The hematology fellow contact[**Name (NI) **] her hematologist at [**Hospital6 **] and, reportedly, the patient has been found to *not* have an ADAMSTS-13 inhibitor in the past, and thus corticosteroids were not felt to be necessary.  She tolerated the first round of plasmapheresis without difficulty.  Her home aspirin was held given her thrombocytopenia.  An ADAMSTS-13 assay was sent (though she had received plasma at the outside hospital).  She had no evidence of bleeding complications. . She was noted to have asymptomatic pyuria on a urinalysis and culture was sent off.  She reported a history of Bactrim-sensitive and quinolone-resistant UTIs in the past.  In spite of the potential marrow-suppressive effects of Bactrim, it was felt that this was preferable for empiric therapy pending return of culture data. . Regarding her neurologic symptoms, she was completely back to baseline at the time of presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] per both her and her husband.  A CT of her head demonstrated evidence of an old right basal ganglia infarction and new acute abnormalities.  Her transient neurologic symptoms were thought to be due to her recurrent TTP.  If symptoms recur, consideration should be given to an MRI and\/or neurologic consultation. . She was kept on her home tolterodine, atorvastatin, and levothyroxine. . For continuity of her hematologic care, she is now being transferred to [**Hospital6 **] Hospital.  She should have a CBC and LDH checked later today.  "}]
