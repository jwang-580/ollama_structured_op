[{"0":" 82 yo male with ESRD on HD, HTN, PVD, CAD s\/p CABG, s\/p PPM\/ICD placement, afib who presented with 2 days onset of dyspnea, lethargy.  in ED found to be hypoxic to 76% on NRB. The patient was admitted to MICU, started on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Levaquin for presumed sepsis. Oxygen saturation has improved to 100% on room air on BiPAP.  BiPAP was discontiniued after several hours and the patient was placed on 4L NC with oxygen saturation above 90%.  Blood cultures from the day of admission grew out GPCs. Hemodialysis catheter was promptly removed.  HD catheter tip cultures yielded Gram positive rods (Staph aureus -- see sensitivities in report). Zosyn and Levaquin were subsequently [**Date Range 8910**], but the patient was continued on Vancomycin. Vancomycin troughs were obtained daily and Vancomycin dose was adjusted accordingly.  The patient was hypotensive on several occasions while in MICU, but always responded well to small fluid boluses of 250cc, and never required pressors.  We were careful to avoid large boluses of fluid as the patient is on dialysis.  The patient was initially febrile, but defervesed by HD#3.  Echocardiogram (TTE) reveraled on evidence of endocarditis, but showed a small pericardial effusion that was not tappable and did not show tamponade physiology.  The patient was subsequently transferred to a medicine floor. He experienced gradual improvement of oxygenation to his baseline over the course of hospitalization (currently over 95% on room air). Thus we concluded that hypoxia was secondary to patient's underlying sepsis.  Nebulizer treatments with Ipratropium and Albuterol were continue throughout hospitalization. A new hemodialysis catheter was placed on [**2118-5-23**] by IR.  The patient continued to receive dialysis on schedule throughout this hospitalization. We continued nephrocaps.  At the time of discharge, the patient is afebrile with stable blood pressures and oxygenation above 95% on room air.  We continued to obtain daily blood cultures.  Blood cultures have not yielded any organisms since [**2118-5-21**].  The patient will need to complete a 14 day total course of Vancomycin since the time of last positive blood cultures to be completed on [**2118-6-3**].  He is being discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  There are a few additional issues that have been stable during this hospitalization, but are discussed below:  Peripheral Vascular Disease: the patient is s\/p angioplasty in [**4-26**]. Wound care consult done for care of his LE ulcers. Dressings were changed regularly.  We continued outpatient management with clopidogrel and aspirin.  We continue to monitor distal pulses.  Coronary Artery Disease - the patient is s\/p CABG.  We continued outpatient management with aspirin, plavix, and beta blocker  Cirrhosis: The patient's mental status has returned to [**Location 213**] once underlying infection was treated.  He was continued on rifaximin for prophylaxis.  The patient had an coagulopathy (INR 1.3-1.4), but no evidence of active bleeding throughout hospitalization.  Pruritis: Pt. with pruritus on his back, likely uremic in nature during this hospitalization.  Treated with Hydrocerin, Sarna lotion and Capsaicin PRN with improved symptoms.  Diet: The patient received Heart Healthy diet supplemented with Boost.  Prophylaxis: The patient received SQ Heparin for DVT Prophylaxis and PPI for GI  prophylaxis.  Communication: with patient and wife; wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 72992**] (cell), [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 72991**] (home).  Code status: Confirmed DNR \/ DNI during this hospitalization.   "}]
