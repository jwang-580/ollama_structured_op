[{"0":" [**12-31**] - CT chest - IMPRESSION: Increase of right-sided pleural effusion and subsequent atelectasis. Complete resolution of the left-sided pleural effusion. No evidence of infection. No evidence of lung nodules or of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. . [**1-4**]- EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, no diagnostic abnormality. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-1-3**] no major change. . [**1-6**] Echo - IMPRESSION: No endocarditis or abscess seen. Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. . [**1-8**] - hepatic ultrasound - IMPRESSION: 1. No biliary ductal dilatation. 2. No evidence of cholecystitis. . [**1-10**] - portable chest x-ray - right apical pneumothorax now showing signs of tension pneumothorax with shifting of the mediastinum . [**2132-2-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-7**], there is a small residual apical pneumothorax. Chest tube remains in place and post-surgical changes are again seen in the right hemithorax. . [**2132-2-9**] CTA: MPRESSION: 1. Gas in the intracranial venous sinuses and cortical veins, as well as in the right internal jugular vein just above the venous catheter entry site. While the large intracranial venous sinuses and large deep basal veins are patent, some of the small cortical veins may be occluded. 2. Extensive multifocal cerebral edema and enhancement, right greater than left, which may be related to venous ischemia. The CT perfusion study supports the presence of ischemia. 3. Focus of gas in the proximal right internal carotid artery, origin uncertain. 4. No evidence of arterial stenoses in the head and neck. No evidence of intracranial arterial aneurysms. 5. Moderate compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body. . [**2132-2-9**] MR head: IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive multifocal cortical swelling, right greater than left, with ishemia and possible infarction, likely related to cortical venous air embolism which is demonstrated on the concurrent head CTA. 2. Small foci of increased susceptibility in the affected cortex may correspond to the air emboli or to microhemorrhages. 3. No occlusion of the large venous sinuses. . [**2132-2-10**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric hypokinesis of the anterior septum and mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise. If there is a suspicion for a paradoxical embolism, a follow-up study by laboratory son[**Name (NI) 16272**] with agitated saline contrast is suggested. . [**2132-2-10**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Progression of extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema. New herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and leftward subfalcine herniation. . [**2132-2-11**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no epileptiform activity. The background activity was very slow and of low voltage suggestive of a severe encephalopathy.  "}]
