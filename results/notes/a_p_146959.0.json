[{"0":" #. Mediastinal mass: He had a history of progressive dysphagia with outpatient workup and biopsy with pathology pending at time of admission.  Mass had been growing quickly and was possibly limiting PO intake and also worsening respiratory distress.  On [**12-6**] path returned with findings suspicious for small cell lung carcinoma, but given necrotic sample, recommended further biopsy.  Pt was taken for repeat broncoscopy on [**12-7**] with interventional pulmonology, however the sample was nondiagnostic.  In the meantime, it was determined that the previous sample was sufficient for diagnosis of carcinoma.  Pt was then taken for intubation and rigid bronchoscopy with bronchial stenting then transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for oncology and radiation treatment.  Had ECHO showing no hemodynamic compromise of the mass.  CT head with contrast showed no ICH or abnormal enhancement. Underwent mapping for XRT followed by first XRT treatment on [**2140-12-7**], and second treatment on [**2140-12-12**]. He will receive a total of 10 treatments.

Antibiotics were changed to vanc\/Zosyn on [**2140-12-8**], then narrowed to just Zosyn and azithromycin on [**2140-12-9**]. He was discharged on oral azithromycin and cefpodoxime  with plan for total 14 day abx course. Influenza testing was negative as were blood and urine cultures, although sputum cultures could not be read due to contamination with oropharyngeal organisms. Required pressors overnight on hospital day one, which were then weaned off, and he remained hemodynamically stable on the floor. He had some deconditioning from the infection and lung cancer. He was seen by physical therapy who recommended outpatient physical therapy.  . #. Acute Renal Failure: This was likely prerenal.  His creatinine trended down with fluids and urine output remained adequate. . #. A Fib: He was found to be in atrial fibrillation and experienced episodic RVR. He was placed on a diltiazem drip with additional rate control with Propafenone.  His anticoagulation was held in the setting of procedurization and he was given 2 units of FFP.
