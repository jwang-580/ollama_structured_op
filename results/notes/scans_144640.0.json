ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2154-8-1**] Findings LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.  LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic function.  AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.  AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.  MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.  PULMONIC VALVE\/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized. No PS. Physiologic PR.  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. . Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional\/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. . IMPRESSION: Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function. Dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.   "}]
