MICU Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU with worsening and cough for 2 weeks in the setting of Afib with RVR.  His SOB was in the setting of new onset afib and an 8lb weight gain and it was believed to due to afib.  He was started on PO Diltiazem 15mg PO QID but he had converted back to sinus rhythm by the time he arrived in the ICU.  He was continued on low dose Diltiazem for control of his afib.  His amlodipine was stopped due to borderline hypotension in the setting of afib.  He was continued on his home COPD regimen of Spiriva and Atrovent and also treated with Albuterol. He is being discharged on albuterol PRN.  Sputum and blood cultures were obtained and were negative. Urine legionella was ordered and was negative.  He was given an insulin sliding scale for his diabetes.  His blood pressure stayed in the 120s-130s\/50s and heart rate remained in the 70s throughout his MICU stay. . # GI Bleed: The patient was transferred to the floor.

The goals of care were discussed with patient and he did not want aggressive care and he did not want a colonoscopy to investigate the source of the bleeding. . #Dyspnea\/cough: The patient's dyspnea and cough were likely due to his COPD exacerbation in conjunction with his chronic lung disease.  He has known pleural effusion and long standing emphysema.  His atrial fibrillation likely exacerbated his dyspnea by causing some mild pulmonary edema.

He was given spiriva, atrovent, and albuterol PRN and was discharged on these medications.
