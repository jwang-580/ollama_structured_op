CT CAP [**2141-4-15**] 1. Extensive retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in addition to enlarged lymph nodes posterior to the descending thoracic aorta. In the setting of recent renal transplant, these findings are worrisome for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder or a lymphoma. 2. Mild ascites. 3. Right shoulder lipoma. 4. Small bilateral pleural effusions. . CT Neck [**2141-4-15**] - Unremarkable . ECHO [**2141-4-17**] - The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. No evidence of endocarditis (cannot be excluded). Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle appears mildly dilated. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  "}]
