BXC: negative multiple times UXC: Negative MRSA: Negative . Path:  Sigmoid colon, laparoscopic colectomy: 1.  Colonic segment with multiple diverticuli and focus of associated acute and chronic inflammation. 2.  Four lymph nodes with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized. 3.  Margins viable. . CXR [**2190-3-1**] There is a large amount of free intraperitoneal gas. Left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacification most likely consistent with atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded in the presence of clinical symptom of fever. Mild prominence of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of overhydration. . CT [**3-2**]: Moderate intraperitoneal air, complex-appearing fluid along Morison's pouch and in the right paracolic gutter, and a small loculation of air contiguous with the free fluid which is just superior to the sigmoid anastomosis. These findings raise suspicion for anastomotic breakdown or leak, although enteric contrast has not reached the anastomosis at the time of the scan. Delayed scanning could confirm this finding if enteric contrast is seen extraluminally. . CT [**3-2**]: Increased attenuation in extraluminal pelvic fluid in post rectal contrast scan, indicating active rectal contrast extravasation. Precise leak location cannot be identified in this study, but is presumed to be from the anastomosis of the sigmoid colectomy. . Echo: [**3-26**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion\/position suggestive of an IVCD. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic valve sclerosis  "}]
