[{"0":" This is a 45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of epilepsy (attributed to MVA in his 20s), anxiety, hypertension, gout, and hypercholesterolemia who is admitted with altered mental status and fall. . CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Resolved gradually over course of hospitalization, but likely from gradual \"build-up\" of multiple prescribed and herbal medications.  Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85823**] states that his PCP has stopped giving him prescriptions for many of his anti-anxiety medications (because he hasn't gone to see her in a while), and he has needed to buy anxiolytics over the internet. Patient is taking clonapin, amitryptiline, and tramadol in addition to sudafed and a supplement that contains lithium. These medications are undoubtedly contributing to confusion, slurred speech, and change in mental status.  However, other etiologies of mental status change must also be considered such as infection or seizure.  Patient did complain of sinus congestion for a few days prior to admission (even missed work on the day prior to admission) but CXR and u\/a unremarkable, and LP not consistent with bacterial infection.  Patient was satrted on acyclovir during hospitalization, but this was stopped prior to discharge.  His HSV PCR is pending, and must be followed up by his outpatient provider. . Another potential etiology of mental status change is seizure (given history) however, patient had a slowly declining mental status (over an hour or two) and no seziure activity was wittnesed and he was not post-ictal.  He was seen by neurology and an EEG was done, which showed general encephalopathic changes. . Patient's unnecessary medications were discontinued: provigil, ultram, citalopram, clonazepam.  His Lamictal was continued. His lithium level was checked until it was 0.3.  An MRI brain did not show evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or infarction. Patient improved on his own and was extubated on [**4-1**].  He was transferred to the general medical floor in stable condition, and was completely alert and oriented.  He was eager to go home on day of discharge.  Neurology also suggested neuro-cognitive testing (patient was complaining of gradual memory loss) as an outpatient. . # SEIZURE DISORDER:  Event unlikely seizure related, with no witnessed event, no post-ictal state, and negative EEG.  Patient was continued on Lamictal 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], and follow-up with his outpatient neurologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12552**]. . # HTN:  Will clarify home BP medications and touch base with patient's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 26998**] for now, but will treat high pressures as needed. . # HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Home regimen unknown.  Patient will follow up with PCP for lipid management. . # ANXIETY\/DEPRESSION: No evidence of overdose except +tox for methadone (which could be related to Ultram patient was taking at home).  Home medication list contains clonazepam and celexa. According to patient, he bought anxiolytics over the internet (the herbal supplements) because he hadn't seen his PCP in some time, and she refused to give him any more prescriptions until he made an appointment.  During admssion, patient was not given any anxiolytics, and exhibited no over signs of anxiety.  He will likely need further treatment for anxiety and depression as an outpatient.  Patient will follow-up with PCP for this issue. He is in agreement with this plan. . # SINUSITIS:  As seen on MRI.  Patient has chronic frontal headaches and post-nasal drip.  He had low-grade fevers on first day of admisison.  Patient will take Augmentin for 14 days as an outpatient.  He will follow-up with his PCP.  "}]
