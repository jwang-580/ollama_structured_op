[**11-14**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. A mobile 2 x 1.4cm mass is seen in the right atrium. It appears to be attached to the Eustachian valve. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mobile mass in the right atrium measuring 2 x 1.4cm. It is associated with the Eustachian valve and has the appearance of a thrombus. It prolapses back and forth into the inferior vena cava. Spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the IVC, consistent with slow flow. The right ventricle has normal size and function. Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function without significant valvular abnormality. . [**11-15**] ECHO: Focused Study: No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. There is a prominent Chiari network versus Eustachian valve seen in the right atrium. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-11-14**], the right atrial mass\/thrombus is no longer present. . CT venogram [**11-19**]: prelim read: No evidence of new venous thrombosis. Interval resolution of IVC thrombus. 3 low attenuation liver lesions, likely benign.   "}]
