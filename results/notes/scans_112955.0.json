[{"0":" CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2173-1-19**]: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly unfolded. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Hilar contours are within normal limits. The lungs demonstrate low inspiratory volumes, but otherwise are clear. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Thoracic scoliosis convex to the right is again demonstrated. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  CT HEAD W\/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2173-1-19**]: FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter reflect chronic microvascular ischemic change. Right frontal and left parieto-occipital lobe encephalomalacia is compatible with old infarcts. Tiny hypodensities in the right subinsular region is consistent with lacunes. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, compatible with age- related involutional change. There has been a right frontal craniotomy. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally aerated. The surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2173-1-21**]: Low lung volumes. The tip of the PICC line remains unchanged. No failure or infiltrates are seen. IMPRESSION: No pneumonia.
