The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion\/position consistent with right ventricular pressure\/volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. (Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.)  CTA chest ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Very minimal questionable subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the left upper lobe. 2. Right pneumonectomy, new loculated air collection with internal septations, worrisome for bronchopleural fistula and potentially empyema. 3. Severe emphysema on the left. Diffuse left lower lobe opacity with interstitial thickening and denser areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation in dependent portions of the left lung, could be related to aspiration or pneumonia. 4. Moderate hiatal hernia. 5. One liver cyst and one liver hypodensity too small to characterize.  Renal ultrasound ([**4-22**]): No evidence of renal obstruction or other abnormality.  Bilateral lower extremity doppler ultrasound ([**4-23**]): 1. Technically limited exam, with non-compressibility and absence of flow within the right superficial femoral vein at its mid portion, concerning or thrombus but not definitive. The right common femoral and popliteal veins are patent. Repeat examination recommended but declined by the family, in the process of initiating CMO status. 2. No left lower extremity DVT.  "}]
