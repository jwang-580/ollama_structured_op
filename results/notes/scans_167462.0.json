Femoral hemodialysis catheter is partially seen. Sternotomy wires and CABG post- operative changes are seen. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of bilateral diaphragms consistent with COPD. No focal consolidation, congestive heart failure, pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. A few left-sided rib fractures appear stable as compared to prior exam. The heart is not enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The bones are osteopenic.  IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation.  Thin linear lucencies adjacent to the liver likely represent free air seen on subsequent CT. Please refer to report on subsequent CT.  Findings consistent with COPD.  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.  DR.

Multiple non-emergent findings in final report. Bowel wall enhancement maybe secondary to hypoperfusion. Wet Read Audit # 1 SHfd FRI [**2149-9-12**] 1:36 PM Small pneumoperitoneum G tube baloon likely in the stomach. Multiple non-emergent findings in final report. Final Report REASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain. Status post gastric tube placement approximately 24 hours ago.  COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis from [**2140-12-28**], [**6-23**], [**2140**]. CTA aorta [**2149-7-31**].  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also submitted for interpretation.  FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate emphysematous and chronic fibrotic changes. The heart is not enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum mostly in the upper abdomen is seen. Too small to characterize hypodensities in the dome of the liver are new since [**2139-8-25**]. The gallbladder is unremarkable. A focal wedge- shaped hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the spleen with punctate calcification may represent prior trauma. The pancreas is fatty infiltrated. Multiple bilateral renal cysts are grossly stable since prior exam. There has been interval increase in perinephric stranding and fluid on the left side. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and iliac vessels is seen. The patient is status post aortobifem bypass. Atherosclerotic calcifications at the origin of patent celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are seen. A hemodialysis catheter extending from the left femoral vein to the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium is seen. There is no lymphadenopathy.  PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter. The prostate gland measures 4.8 cm in transverse diameter, mildly enlarged.  GI TRACT: Contrast within the colon likely represents barium from prior esophagogram from [**2149-9-4**]. There is no bowel obstruction. Mucosal enhancement of the wall of the stomach and small bowel may represent hypoperfusion. No wall thickening is seen. There is a gastric tube with the tip within the stomach.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Severe osteopenia and degenerative changes with no acute fracture are seen.  IMPRESSION: Small amount of pneumoperitoneum, especially within the superior aspect of the abdomen, likely secondary to recent gastric tube placement. Gastric tube tip is within the stomach.  New left perirenal fluid and stranding is of unclear etiology, could perhaps be due to a recently passed stone.  Gastric and small bowel wall enhancement may be related to hypoperfusion. Clinical correlation is recommended.  Too small to characterize hypodensities in the dome of the liver are new since [**2139-8-25**].

(and more)  DIAGNOSIS:  Amputation, second left toe: 1.  Gangrenous necrosis and acute inflammation involving skin, subcutaneous soft tissue, and underlying bone. 2.  Bony and soft tissue resection margin free of necrosis and acute inflammation.  Clinical: Second toe. Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled \"[**Known lastname 3647**], [**Known firstname 122**] A\" with the medical record number and additionally labeled \"left second toe\". The specimen is an ulcerated gangrenous toe that measures 3.9 x 1.7 x 2.2 cm. The toe has a dark gangrenous area at the most distal end of  the toe, which measures approximately 1.4 x 1.6 cm . The nail is fragmented. Immediately proximal to the gangrenous area is an area of ulceration with circumferential necrosis. This area measures 1.7 x 1.5 cm and the underlying bone is seen. The resection margin has pink healthy soft tissue. The specimen is represented as follows: A = samples of gangrenous area with abutting non gangrenous tissues, B = necrotic ulcerated area, C = soft tissue margin, D = bone underlying necrotic area with attached tendon, E = bony margin. D and E are submitted for decalcification.
