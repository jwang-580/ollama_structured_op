[{"0":" # UGIB  Given his history of right portal vein thrombosis there is concern he may have back up of blood flow to the esophageal and gastric veins which may have ruptured and led to his UGIB. - Pt transfused 6 units of pRBCs (Hct on presentation 16.7). He was also placed on octreotide gtt and PPI [**Hospital1 **]. GI performed EGD with banding of 4 cords of non-bleeding, grade II varices that were seen in the lower third of the esophagus. Carafate was begun with a plan for 5-day course. Repeat EGD in 2 weeks was recommended by GI. - After EGD pt was transferred from the ICU to the floor where his Hct was followed closely. Pt maintained stable Hct post-transfusion throughout hospitalization (Hct 31.0). - Pt was started on cipro ppx given UGIB and ascites. - AST\/ALT slightly elevated above baseline, however his alk phos is lower and t\/bili only slightly elevated when compared to b\/l. Given these findings it is less likely he has developed a recurrent common hepatic duct stricture (s\/p removal pigtail stent on [**9-15**]). . # GPC in ED blood culture, 1\/4 bottles - possibly contaminant, however, pt was started on vancomycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending. Final culture revealed S. viridans.  Cultures were obtained prior to EGD and pt has no lines of concern for infection. Pt underwent Echo which showed no vegetations or signs of SBE.  Because all follow up cultures were negative and pt was afebrile and asymptomatic during his hospitalization the vancomycin was discontinued and he was startd on a two week course of clindamycin. . # Anion gap metabolic acidosis Secondary to elevated lactate in setting UGIB with hypoperfussion. Resolved with blood products and IVF. . # Hypercalcemia - On transfer to the floor pt was found to have elevated serum calcium (Ca 11.8, Alb 3.0).  Pt was started on continuous IVF and lasix. Pt responded well and had calcium of 9.1 on discharge. . # Liver cancer - Patient off treatment since early [**Month (only) 205**].  Pt was not restarted on any chemotherapy during hospitalization.  [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from palliative care.   "}]
