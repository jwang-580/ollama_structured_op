[{"0":" 1. Foot Ulcers She was initially admitted to the podiatry service on [**2167-7-10**] for debridement of left foot wound. She was evaluated by vascular surgery who performed right side angiography, revealing significant SFA and popliteal disease which was not intervened upon. She was covered with cipro\/flagyl\/vanco (Day 1 = [**2167-7-10**]), and remained afebrile without leukocytosis throughout her hospital course.  She was then transitioned to bactrim to complete a 2 week course of outpatient therapy, last day [**2167-7-28**]. She will be following up in 1 week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She will have home VNA for assistance with daily dressing changes.  2. Seizures She was to be discharged to home with TMP\/SMX and then follow-up with podiatry in one week. On the morning of likely discharge while eating breakfast, she asked to be transferred to the comode to pass a BM. On the comode she describes acute onset of nausea and weakness. She then was witnessed to have multiple, recurrent brief episodes of \"staring spells\" during which she was unresponsive. In between these episodes she responded appropriately to voice. Based on concern for seizures, she was given ativan 1mg x 2 without response. Neurology consult was obtained who described persistant complex partial status, and recommended ativan 2mg x 1 with subsequent dilantin loading. The pt remained in status for ~30-45 min.  By report, during the episode, her O2 sats dropped to 79%RA, but BP was stable. Post event, transfer note indicates VS 98.8 109\/68 92 14 98%3L. Immediately after her the seizures, pt was with the above vital signs, sitting up in bed, somnolent, responsive to voice. Her somnolence intermittently resolved, notably upon the arrival of her PCP whom she recognized and spoke with. MICU transfer was requested in the setting of persistent complex partial status for closer airway monitoring and for evaluation of potential contribution by patient's multiple medical conditions. Etiology of her seizures was thought likely related to poorly controlled seizures, further triggered by infection and decreased seizure threshold in the setting of quinolone therapy.   On the floor, she remained seizure free. She refused EEG as recommended by Neuro. She was started on Zonegram per Neuro in addition to her home Carbamazepine. IV Dilantin was discontinued. CT Head was negative for bleed. She was resumed on her home coumadin. Pt has an appt scheduled with neuro for follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], given limited availability of appts with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was given the number to call to check for cancellations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. . #. h\/o DVT Pt had been transitioned off coumadin in anticipation of wound debridgement\/surgical intervention. She was resumed on Coumadin with Lovenox bridge after CT Head negative for bleed. She was discharged home on her home coumadin dose (no Lovenox bridge, with hx of remote and fully treated DVT), with INR to be checked and followed by the [**Hospital 2786**] clinic. . # Transaminitis. New on [**7-15**] AM labs (but no LFTs done prior in admission). Etiology unclear - ?new drug effect. Seems soon for dilantin (within ~1 hour). Cipro a rare cause; should not be flagyl or vanco related. No rash or other evidence of drug reaction. Could also possibly be related to anesthesia meds during angiography. Atorvastatin was held and will be re-evaluated for resumption as outpatient. On day of discharge transaminitis had resolved. Further etiology will be evaluated as outpatient. . # Elevated lipase: unclear etiology. Appears to have remained chronically elevated over past few years. Pt otherwise asymptomatic. Will be followed up further as outpatient. . # Deconditioning: pt with difficulty transferring from bed to commode\/wheelchair, which improved during her stay.  #. DM: stable, with sugars occasionally elevated in the pm. Continue SSI and fixed dose, with further adjustment at PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**]. . #. Coronary Artery Disease: stable, continue beta blocker, ACEI, plavix, nitrate. Atorvastatin held given new transaminitis. Consider resuming this as outpatient. Not on aspirin due to allergy. . # Abnormal UA- trace leuks, large blood. Asymptomatic with negative urine culture. Most likely [**3-16**] foley trauma. Was removed with incident, and no hematuria resulting. . # FEN: diabetic (though refuses, switched to regular), replete electrolytes prn # Prophylaxis: anticoagulated with coumadin # Access: peripherals # Code: FULL CODE    "}]
