[{"0":" 24 year old man with poorly controlled DM and HTN with ESRD not yet on HD presents with DKA in setting of insulin noncompliance and an underlying viral pneumonia versus viral URI. He was admitted to the ICU and started on an insulin drip. The anion gap closed and he was transitioned to glargine in the morning (22 units) and maintained on a sliding scale. He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) 387**] consult team while hospitalized and will see them as an outpatient this week. He had abnormal chest film along with cough and chills.  He was started on empiric levofloxacin, however, his flu swab came back positive for influenza A and the antibiotics were discontinued. The influenza was not H1N1 by state lab testing. He was afebrile for 24 hours prior to discharge. We found normocytic anemia likely from CKD. Iron studies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge. They will be followed up by the [**Hospital **] clinic and he will likely be started on epoetin as an outpatient. He was discharged on empiric iron.   "}]
