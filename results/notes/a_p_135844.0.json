[{"0":" # tongue swelling - Likely [**12-23**] angioedema.  Most common trigger would be medications, although an acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is not excluded.  Her medications include an ACEI, which can cause angioedema.  Although this idiosyncratic reaction often presents within two months of starting the drug, and this patient started the medication six years ago, this is a possible trigger.  Another possibility could include everolimus.  The patient was given a short prednisone burst and antihistamines, to which she showed complete resolution of symptoms in ~12 hours.  She was discharged on a short prednisone taper, and her ACEI was switched to amlodipine for blood pressure control.  Given her current ongoing malignancy, we opted to keep her on Sutent for now pending further discussion with her outpatient oncologist, with whom she is scheduled to visit as an outpatient the day following discharge.  The patient could also benefit from Allergy follow-up as an outpatient for further workup of her tongue swelling.  This should also be discussed with her oncologist as an outpatient.  # mild AMS - Patient developed mild confusion the AM of discharge, which we believe was most likely due to excessive anti-histamine use coupled with zolpidem 10 mg qhs.  We advised the patient to avoid regular antihistamine use, and also advised her to lower the zolpidem to 5 mg hs.  "}]
