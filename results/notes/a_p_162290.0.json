[{"0":" Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a 63 yo M w\/hx COPD and schizophrenia who is admitted for fevers and leukocytosis with RLL infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. . Pneumonia, recurrent, with acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] was admitted with pneumonia, right lung, in the same location as previously this summer, on prior admissions with significant leukocytosis.  This was thought to reflect either aspiration event, or possibly recurrent pneumonia, possibly post-obstructive.  He was initially placed on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. He then developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required ICU admission. At that point, his antibiotic coverage was broadened to cover pseudomonas and MRSA with Zosyn and Vancomycin. In the MICU, he was on BIPAP for approximately 2 hours, which he did not tolerate, and then was transitioned back to nasal cannula.  He was transferred to the floor three days prior to discharge. Urine legionella was negative. Sputum cultures were checked and grew normal flora. Due to concern for aspiration, he was seen by the speech and swallow service, and had a video swallow evaluation.  This revealed no evidence of aspiration.  He was maintained on a regular diet.   Given the recurrent nature of the pneumonia, he will require further imaging in 4 weeks, either CT or xray, to verify resolution of the pneumonia. . COPD exacerbation: he was given albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments, and started on prednisone 60 mg daily. When transferred to the MICU, he was started on IV solumedrol for 3 days.  He was then transitioned back to PO prednisone.  He was also on nebulizers.  He will be restarted on advair and spiriva at discharge, as well as a prednisone taper.  He will also require home oxygen. . Schizophrenia:  He was maintained on risperdal, and overall his mental status was stable.  He was at times anxious, but had a very calm demeanor in his last 3 days of hospitalization. . Disposition:  He was noted to be unkempt on admission. He was seen by social work, and home services and evaluation was arranged.  "}]
