[{"0":" 87 yo F with hx of dCHF, AVR, MRV, DMII, recent bacteremia, here with worsening dyspnea and concern for acute on chronic dHF.  # Acute on chronic dCHF: In the setting of recent hospitalization for bacteremia, during which time the patient had IVF's and less diuretics. On admission, the patient had bilateral pitting edema to the sacrum and pulmonary rales. She was given Aldactone & IV Lasix PRN with good diuresis. Her electrolytes were carefully monitored and repleted [**Hospital1 **]. She was maintained on a low salt diet and a 1500ml fluid restriction. On HD #5, she had a hypotensive event in the morning which was triggered - she got a fluid bolus and then was maintained on continuous IVF. Later that day she was found to be unresponsive with a run of torsades. A code was called, but this event was self-limited and the patient re-gained pulses. She was sent to the MICU. EP saw her, discussion below. She had intermittent chest pain without EKG changes or enzyme leak in the MICU, which was controlled with nitro\/morphine. She was ultimately transferred out of the MICU after 3 nights. Her fluid status kept even, and she did have some swelling of her LEs on Lasix. She was given prn lasix, and her daily diuretic was changed to Bumex 2 mg [**Hospital1 **]. By day of discharge she had clear lungs on exam with decreased LE swelling. She continued to have occasional bouts of intermittent chest pain without EKG changes or telemetry events, which was controlled with SL nitroglycerine. She was continued on her CCB, Imdur and her statin. . # C. difficile colitis: Patient with leukocytosis & fever to 101 on HD 5. She was started empirically on Flagyl for presumed C. diff in the context of completing 2 week antibiotic course and ID was consulted to determine whether she required additional coverage for Salmonella. They recommended that she remain on monotherapy with Flagyl, but the patient's condition continued to deteriorate requiring a ICU transfer (see above). Her C. diff toxin returned positive in the interim and her coverage was broadened to Vancomycin\/Flagyl. However, given the concern of medications that might prolong the QT interval, she was switched to monotherapy PO Vancomycin per ID recommendations. She was transferred to the floor on this medication. ID requested a pelvic ultrasound given a finding of adnexal cyst on her CT from her early [**Month (only) **] admission and low possibility that this could be a site of infection; this was done and she had small interval increase in size from previous study in [**2130**] but no change in morphology or other concerning characteristics. She is to continue on Vancomycin for two weeks total (day 1 = [**4-2**]). She continued to have a moderate amount of diarrhea and occasional blood in her stool, likely related to an elevated INR (see below). She did have a somewhat distended abdomen on exam but did not have point tenderness, rebound, guarding, and was not tympanic. She had occasional complaints of abdominal pain but in general these were of short duration and responded well to Maalox\/lidocaine. She was started on Sucralfate for suspected gastritis. A KUB was done on [**4-10**] with a read of \"There is a large amount of stool throughout the colon. No discrete obstruction is identified. Air-filled small bowel is also identified, but this does not appear to be pathologically dilated at this time.\" A KUB was repeated on [**4-12**] and was read as stool in the colon without any signs of pneumoperitoneum or bowel obstruction. The patient will need to continue on a bowel regimen. . # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Creatinine remained stable at her baseline throughout her stay on the medicine floor despite receiving Lasix. She did receive several extra doses of lasix related to fluid overload following her MICU stay. Her diuretic was changed to Bumex. Spironolactone was continued. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as necessary.  # DMII: Patient maintained on a fixed dose & insulin sliding scale throughout this hospitalization. [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes center was consulted and made recommendations regarding her insulin doses.  # h\/o Atrial Fibrillation: Patient is AV paced at 60bpm; she initially remained in NSR during this hospitalization. She was on her home Amiodarone & Metoprolol. On [**4-2**], she had an episode of Torsades and a code blue was called, as discussed above. She returned to a perfusing rhythm. EP saw the patient and interrogated her pacemaker and confirmed Torsades. She had an EKG after event without evidence of ischemia. Notably, her baseline EKG had a long QT. She was evaluated for any QT-prolonging medications; these included amiodarone and fluconazole (which had been continued from her previous admission for concern over [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis). Her amiodarone and metoprolol were held. EP increased her baseline HR to decrease her QT. Her troponins were cycled and were negative. She had been started on Flagyl briefly for Salmonella, but this was discontinued given its possible QT effects. Following transfer to the floor, she had no further events on telemetry. Several repeat EKGs were done and these demonstrated gradual resolution of the prolonged QTc (487 msec to 473 msec). Final EKG done before discharge was stable. . # Hx of Rheumatic Fever s\/p AVR\/MVR: Goal INR 2.5-3.5, with history of very poorly maintained INR's. Patient's INR was subtherapeutic on admission and she was temporarily placed on a Heparin gtt to Coumadin, but this was stopped at the preference of her family given prior episodes of bleeding on Heparin. Her home Coumadin dose was temporarily increased to 5mg daily and then titrated down to 3mg daily with a therapeutic INR reached on HD 5. She was also placed on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. In the MICU, her INR was supratherapeutic and was held. She had a nosebleed, and received vitamin K. Prior to transfer back to the floor, she was re-started on her coumadin, and the family agreed to heparin bridge. This was stopped after her INR came up to 2.5. She again became supratherapeutic, and her coumadin was again held. It was restarted on [**4-10**] at 2 mg daily. Her INR was 2.6 on the day of discharge. . # Esophagitis: Patient with a diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis on last admission, treated with 3 weeks of Fluconazole that was completed on re-admission. She demonstrated no evidence of persistent infection during this hospitalization, but she was continued on her home PPI as well Tessilon Perles & Cepacol lozenges for ongoing cough. The fluconazole was stopped as above. She did have some throat pain after transfer back from the MICU and was given Maalox\/Lidocaine with generally good relief. . # Elevated LFTs: Patient admitted with elevated Alkaline phosphatase, AST, & GGT, normal bilirubin. Initially, she c\/o RUQ pain on exam, but refused RUQ ultrasound.  Her LFT's were monitored given her history of Salmonella, but all levels normalized on HD4 except the patient's Alkaline phosphatase. She did not have pain that was localized to the RUQ but did have occasional vague abdominal pain that was improved with maalox, sucralfate, and tylenol as above. Her KUBs were significant for possible constipation and her laxatives were re-started. . # Hypothyroid: Patient's TSH was 6.3 during this hospitalization. Prior free T4 obtained within the last 6 months was within normal limits She was maintained on 37.5mcg daily. . # Insomnia: The patient came in on report that she received trazadone prn for insomnia, but this was tried with negative effects (daughter reported that patient had hallucinations). Trazadone was stopped. The patient was given Alprazolam prn for her anxiety and insomnia. . # Code: Patient was FULL CODE on admission, but on [**4-2**], after Torsades, patient's family decided to change her code status to DNR\/DNI . # Emergency Contact: Daughter, [**Name (NI) 8463**] [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 103841**]  "}]
