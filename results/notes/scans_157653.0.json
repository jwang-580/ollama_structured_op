Imaging: [**2116-8-8**] CXR:  Dense consolidation within the left lower lobe consistent with aspiration versus pneumonia. . [**2116-7-3**] Chest CT: 1. Slight interval increase in size of 1.9 x 1.6 cm right mid lung nodular opacity, containing both solid and ground-glass components as described, which is highly concerning for recurrent bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma. 2. New anterior right mid lung tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for aspiration or infection. Given mild hiatal hernia, and distal esophageal thickening, with right basilar bronchiectatic change, this could represent chronic aspiration. . [**2116-7-13**] Spirometry: FEV1\/FVC 58, There is an obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC suggests a coexisting restrictive ventilatory defect which is confirmed by the reduced TLC measured on [**2103-3-7**]. Compared to the prior study of [**2116-2-10**] there has been no significant change.   "}]
