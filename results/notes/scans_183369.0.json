Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  Impression: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Normal left ventricular function. Mild mitral regurgitation.  =============  CHEST X-RAY ============= The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The osseous structures appear within normal limits.  IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.  ==================   DISCHARGE LABS ==================  WBC-6.7 RBC-3.82* Hgb-12.5* Hct-36.0* MCV-94 MCH-32.8* MCHC-34.8 RDW-14.1 Plt Ct-188 PT-13.9* INR(PT)-1.2* Glucose-97 UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-140 K-3.6 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-11 Calcium-9.3 Phos-3.9 Mg-1.6 BLOOD TSH-1.4  "}]
