DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.  OTHER STUDIES ================ Right Upper Quadrant U\/S [**2201-3-25**]: IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited evaluation. Liver appears echogenic, a finding which can be seen in fatty infiltration. More advanced forms of liver disease, such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be completely excluded.  Gallbladder is contracted and filled with stones.  Chest Radiograph [**2201-3-28**]: IMPRESSION: New patchy opacity at right base of uncertain significance -- ? new atelectasis versus early infiltrate versus differences in appearance due to change in positioning. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to further assess this finding.  ECG [**2201-3-24**]:  Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality and occasional ventricular ectopy.  Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Probable prior inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-10-7**] ventricular ectopy has appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change.   "}]
