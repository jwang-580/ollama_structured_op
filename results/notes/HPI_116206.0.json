[{"0":"  [**2146-4-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-4-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 68839**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right great toe amputation  History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with MDS, CAD, CHF, and CKD as well as multiple recent admissions for bacteremia secondary to a gangrenous toe who presented yesterday with fever and hypotension.  The patient reports \"a couple\" of days of feeling generally unwell with malaise and a fever.  He is not able to endorse any localizing symptoms like cough, chest pain, dysuria\/hematuria, or abdominal discomfort.  He also endosres some loose stools over the past few days but no [**Age over 90 **] diarrhea. No other abdominal symptoms and he denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  He was sent to the ED after his daughter noted him rigoring at rehab and demanded he be sent to the hospital.  In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P 120 BP 132\/80 R 26 O2 sat 99% on NRB but temperature then spiked to 104.2 rectally.  As the patient has had multiple admissions for bacteremia related to his toe gangrene vascular and podiatry were consulted regarding management.  The patient was given levofloxacin, acetaminophen, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.  He became hypotensive (SBP's in the 90's) and thus received 2L of NS without much effect before before being started on norepinephrine and sent to the ICU.  Overnight the patient was weaned off norepinephrine.  He also defervesced and has been afebrile today.  He received one unit Plt and one unit pRBC's as was worse than baseline.  ID consulted and are recommending daptomycin (patient was on course as an outpatient) and pipercillin-tazobactam as well as discontinuing PICC and scan to r\/o abscess.  Plan was for podiatry to amputate toe in AM but patient's daughter and HCP requested vascular to perform this operation so timing is currently unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] report blood cultures from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab are growing gram positive cultures in pairs and clusters as well as gram negative rods.  Currently, he reports feeling fatigued but denies specific complaints.
