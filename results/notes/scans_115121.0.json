[**2166-12-17**] Peritoneal fluid: Albumin was 1.8, LDH was [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 43426**] nucleated cells of which on preliminary analysis many appeared malignant. Final cytology pending. . [**2166-12-19**] Cell block, peritoneal fluid: Mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes and red blood cells. Cytology pending. . [**2166-12-24**] Pathology report from mesenteric biopsy: Burkitt's. . [**2166-12-26**] Bone Marrow: Peripheral Blood Smear: The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes demonstrate anisopoikilocytosis.  They appear to have increased central pallor, with scattered polychromatophils present.  Abnormal forms including target cells, ecchinocytes, and elliptocytes are also present.  The white blood cell count appears normal. Platelet count appears normal with rare clumping.  Large forms are seen.  Differential count shows 69% neutrophils, 5% monocytes, 2%lymphocytes, 1% basophils, 3% atypical mononuclear cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles within deep blue cytoplasm. . Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and shows several cellular spicules with many stripped nuclei.  The M:E ratio is 0.9:1.  Erythroid precursors are present in mildly megaloblastoid maturation.  Myeloid precursors appear normal in number and show left shifted maturation.  Megakaryocytes are present in decreased numbers.  Differential shows: 3% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 12% Myelocytes, 14% Metamyelocytes, 14% Bands\/Neutrophils, 13% Plasma cells, 16% Lymphocytes, 35% Erythroid.  There are foamy hemosiderin laden macrophages present in the smear.  There are large cells with intensely blue cytoplasm with vacuoles. . Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and demonstrates a fragmented cellular core (overall cellularity of 20-30%). There are increased plasma cells and mast cells.  There is an eosinophilic background.  The M:E ratio estimate is decreased. Erythroid precursors are increased in number and show normoblastic maturation.  Myeloid elements are relatively decreased in number and exhibit full spectrum maturation. Megakaryocytes are present in normal number.  There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring in small clusters occupying 20% of marrow cellularity.  Marrow clot section is not submitted.  Touch prep is not submitted. . Special Stains: Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.  Storage iron is increased.  Sideroblasts are present.  Ring sideroblasts are absent.  . EKG: sinus rhythm, HR 80, normal axis, normal intervals, non pathologic q-waves in II, III, aVF. [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in III. . RADIOGRAPHIC DATA: CXR [**2166-12-22**]: There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Apical pleural thickening bilaterally, more prominent on the right, consistent with old granulomatous disease. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Loss of height of a mid dorsal vertebra, most likely on a postmenopausal basis. . CT CHEST [**2166-12-19**]: 1. CALCIFIED SCARRING AT THE LUNG APICES. CALCIFIED MEDIASTINAL LYMPH NODES. CALCIFICATIONS IN THE LIVER AND SPLEEN. THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF CHRONIC TUBERCULOSIS OR ANOTHER CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION. 2. BILATERAL CALCIFIED PLEURAL PLAQUES, WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY ALSO RELATED TO A CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS INFECTION. HOWEVER, ASBESTOS EXPOSURE [**Month (only) **] ALSO BE CONSIDERED, AND CLINICAL CORRELATION IS SUGGESTED. 3. SMALL BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. 4. ABDOMINAL ASCITES, WHICH WAS BETTER ASSESSED ON THE [**2166-12-16**] ABDOMINAL CT SCAN. 5. 9 MM LUCENT LESION IN THE LEFT GLENOID WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE FEATURES, WHICH MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS A SUBCHONDRAL CYST. HOWEVER, A METASTASIS CANNOT ENTIRELY BE EXCLUDED, AND A BONE SCAN [**Month (only) **] BE CONSIDERED. 6. MODERATE COMPRESSION DEFORMITIES OF THE VERTEBRAL BODIES OF T7 AND T12, OF UNKNOWN CHRONICITY. . [**2166-12-16**] CT ABDOMEN ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]): ASCITES. OMENTAL THICKENING THAT [**Month (only) **] REFLECT PERITONEAL CARCINOMATOSIS. THERE IS ASYMMETRIC FULLNESS OF THE LEFT PELVIC ADNEXA BUT NO DEFINITE MASS IS IDENTIFIED. SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. OLD GRANULOMATOUS DISEASE. . [**2166-12-27**] ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional\/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is inadequate to fully assess aortic valve, however mild stenosis is suggested based on two-dimensional images. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Calcific aortic valve disease with mild regurgitation and probable mild stenosis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Compared with the report of the resting portion of the prior stress study (images unavailable for review) of [**2163-9-9**], tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension are now seen. Aortic valve is not fully assessed on the current emergency study. The other findings appear similar. . [**2167-1-2**] LE Ultrasound: The examination was negative for DVT in the lower extremities. . [**2167-1-12**] Chest CT: 1. Diffuse ground-glass opacity and more focal left upper lobe subpleural opacity. Findings most likely reflect an infectious process or drug-related alveolitis. 2. Right PICC line lies at the level of the tricuspid valve. 3. Moderately-severe aortic valve calcifications of uncertain physiologic significance. . [**2167-1-25**] Chest CT: 1. Interval progression of diffuse ground-glass opacity, which remains most consistent with an infectious process such as a viral or atypical pneumonia, or drug-reaction. 2. No pleural effusion. 3. Calcified pleural plaques and interstitial lung disease, may represent asbestos-related disease. . [**2167-1-25**] Shoulder film: Three views of the right shoulder demonstrate some mild degenerative changes with small osteophytes but no fracture is identified. As seen in the chest CT from the prior day there is right apical pleural plaque and increased interstitial markings on the right. . [**2167-1-26**] Bronchoscopy: preliminary negative .  .   "}]
