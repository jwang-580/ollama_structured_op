PT: 20.8  PTT: 85.1  INR: 1.9 OSH EKG [**9-18**]: NSR @ 61bpm.  LBBB. No ST segment changes.  CXR on admission [**9-18**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs evocative of pulmonary edema have slightly decreased. However, today's image shows a typical presentation of mild-to-moderate persisting pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly, increased vascular markings, increased reticulations and a borderline width of the right mediastinum. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus but cannot exclude the presence of a small pleural effusion. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. Unchanged alignment of sternal wires after sternotomy. Status post valvular replacement. The PICC line projects with its tip over the superior SVC.   "}]
