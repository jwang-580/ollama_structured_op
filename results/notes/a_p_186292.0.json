[{"0":" A 74 year-old woman presenting with clear signs of a systemic infection, including fevers, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate. Likely source is right leg cellulitis. . 1. Infection, cellulitis. At admission, she had significant pain and erythema at the site of the right leg laceration. Her systemic symptoms were felt to be due to inflammatory response from the cellulitis. She was admitted to the MICU overnight for monitoring given concern of SIRS (tachycardia, tachypnea, lactic acidosis), and started empirically on IV vancomycin. The next morning she returned to the medicine floors with stable vitals and resolved acidosis. The area of cellulitis had also decreased substantially in size. She continued to have intermittent episodes of chills, with fevers up to 101, on the vancomycin. Blood cultures were repeatedly drawn, and these all returned negative (including cultures taken from the ED). Urine cultures were also negative. She underwent transthoracic echo for concern of endocarditis. This showed normal ejection fraction with no valvular vegetations. Once therapeutic on the vanco, her fever curve began down-trending, although she continued to have occasional episodes of chills. She underwent right leg MRI which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. She also had lower extremity dopplers that were negative for DVT. Liver enzymes were checked for concern of alcalculous cholecystitis; these were mildly elevated but consistent with her baseline transaminitis, likely from NAFLD. After five days of vancomycin, with no positive culture data, we switched her to oral Linezolid to complete a fourteen day course. At time of discharge, she has not had fevers in over 24 hours. Her last recorded fever was 100.0. She had a markedly elevated CRP (222) during this admission, and it is felt her fevers and chills are due to a prolonged inflammatory response to the cellulitis. Symptomatically she feels improved, and her cellulitis is resolving. . 2. Hypertension. Her atenolol-chlorthalidone was held at admission due to hypotension in the setting of possible sepsis. Once stable on the floors, her antihypertensive was restarted without complication. . 3. Hypothyroidism. We continued her home levothyroxine. . 4. Chronic Pain\/neuropathy. We continued her home pain regimen, which includes gabapentin, lidocaine patch, tolmetin and cyclobenzaprine prn. . 5. Gastrointestinal reflux disease. We continued her home proton pump inhibitor. . 6. Chronic bronchitis. We continued her home albuterol. . She was kept on a normal diet. Subcutaneous heparin, then pneumoboots, were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Her code status is DNI, but okay to resuscitate. This was confirmed with patient and daughter during this admission.  "}]
