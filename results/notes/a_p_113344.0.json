[{"0":" 74 yo F w\/ Stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer, ARF on CVVH, and malignant pleural effusion.  Course has been complicated by hypotension requiring pressors (levophed).  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.  #. Hypotension\/shock.  Has required Levophed for much of admission.  Last 2-3 days prior to leaving the MICU for the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she tolerated several hours without pressors; however, she received albumin or blood during these periods.   Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, hypovolemia. - [**Name (NI) 15305**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D\/c abx on [**9-25**]: pt received 6 days of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  Line infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d\/c??????ed.  Will monitor PICC line for signs of infection. - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.  Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned because pt had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to monitor, however, this episodes appears to be isolated. - Cardiogenic-  Originally, was concerned for tamponade. Although they have been suboptimal studies, multiple echoes have only showed effusions without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade with one exception.  Her echo from [**9-15**] showed impaired fillling\/tamponade physiology.  Most recent echo on [**9-24**] again did not show evidence of tamponade, just small effusion. Also, echo on [**9-24**] revealed normal RV size and motion which made PE less likely.  Throughout her course in the MICU, have considered V\/Q scan to r\/o PE as a possible cause of hypotension however, given her echo findings, the pretest possibility remains equivocal. - On [**9-22**], SVV (from Vigileo) suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for much of that day.  For last few days prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], have been running CVVH at a 0 balance.  Gave albumin challenge again on [**9-25**] and her CVP bumped to 12 and was thus able to be off of leveophed for several hours. It appeared that she needs her CVP to be [**1-4**] to maintain her BP.  Goal has been to wean levophed and have considered transitioning to midodrine as an oral pressor. - At time of transfer, the etiology of her hypotension remains elusive.  Without an adequate explanation, team has hypothesized that this may be a possible paraneoplastic syndrome.  # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c\/w malignancy. Final cytology from right effusion still pending at time of transfer but pH, cell counts, gluc, prot consistent with left effusion and anticipate that it will also be malignant. Prior to first thoracentesis, pt required BiPap but upon transfer, pt has been satting well on only 1.5L NC for several days.  Underwent both chest tube and pigtail placement for left sided effusion.  Chest tube was removed early in course of stay because it was extrathoracic and not draining but pigtail (placed by IP) continues to drain serosang fluid.  Was placed to water seal by IP on [**9-25**].  A repeat CT on [**9-22**] showed increased right sided effusion which was tapped on [**9-24**].  IP is considering either Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable.  Has also used bronchodilators for wheezing.  On [**10-3**], chest tube fell out. Per IP, Ok to leave out, re-image if symptomatic.  Pleural effusion should be responsive to chemo if tumor is.  However, if reaccumulates, will need pleurex catheter v pleurodesis.  Should follow-up with IP in [**Hospital 3782**] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 3020**] two weeks post-discharge or immediately if SOB.  #. Acute renal failure ?????? Persistent volume overload and anasarca.  Originally admitted with K of 7.8 and Cr of 7.2. Hyperkalemia resolved quickly (see below).  Held on dialysis for a few days but CVVH was started on [**9-16**] but had to be stopped temporarily on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line changed over the wire by renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH. Initial and repeat imaging of kidneys has showed continued right hydronephrosis.  Plan is to transfer from MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name **]) to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in order to go to the OR with urology on [**9-26**].  Urology will place a stent in the right ureter.  Goal of stenting is to relieve the obstruction with the hope of regaining some kidney function.  Acutely on [**9-24**], she developed hyponatremia and hyperglycemia. Unclear etiology but hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.  Pt was placed on insulin sliding scale for the elev glucose.  Initially, pt was hyperphosphatemic but on the day of transfer pt required repletion of phos.  Used Na-Phos for added sodium benefit.  Have held home Lasix and ACE-I in setting of ARF.  # Metastatic ovarian cancer: cardiopulmonary status has been too tenuous for treatment during this admission.  Obtained tumor markers which revealed borderline high CA-125 and elevated CA27,29, but were overall non-specific.  Heme onc is following closely and feel that pt will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum.  Family has been supportive of continuing more aggressive means of treatment. Have discussed transfer to OMED when stable and off pressors. Gyn onc originally saw the pt but have not been following daily.  Also, on allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.  #. Hypothyroidism ?????? Was diagnosed with hypothyroidism approx 2 weeks prior to admission and had been started on a low dose of Synthroid. Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension. Preliminary thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg on [**9-25**].  Per endo, should re-check a Free T4 level in 3 to 4 days. Anti-TPO ab < 10.  Also, changed from oral to IV Synthroid to ensure proper absorption despite this one episode of questionable a. fib.  #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Was most likely due to worsening renal function, esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w\/ Ca gluconate, insulin \/ dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.  Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained wnl.  #. Hyperlipidemia - Taking home statin dose.  #. [**Name (NI) 8410**] Pt remains full code at time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course:  #. Hypotension and Sepitc shock: the patient had been on-and-off pressors for the length of her ICU admissions. She responded well to albumin and IV fluids however the response was short-lived. She was eventually weaned off pressors and started on corticosteroids which improved her pressure significantly. However, during her ICU stay she began to deteriorate and her course was complicated by C. diff colitis tx with IV flagyl po\/pr vancomycin.  Additionally, she developed a VAP w\/ pseudomonas and was treated with ceftazidime.  The patient's [**Female First Name (un) **] fungemia was treated with caspofungin.  The patient was maintained and three pressors and remained intubated.  Maximal treat was administered, but the patients status continued to decline and she remained pressor dependent.  The family decided to stop pressors on [**2138-10-29**] and the patient passed away at 7:50pm.  # Renal failure: Post stent placement by urology the patient's urine output did not improve significantly. Due to patient's labile blood pressure and tendency towards hypotension she was started CVVH. She was subsequently tried on HD, given albumin and fluids for volume, and eventually maintained a low but steady blood pressure with concominant tachycardia. However, as the patient's clincal course declined as did her renal function.  She was no longer a candidate for CVVH due to her hypotension and worsening clincal picture.  Her creatinine continued to trend upwards and she had multiple electrolyte abnormalities including continued hyperkalemia that was refractory to treatment.  The patient was essentially anuric and passed away when her pressors were stopped.  # Tachycardia: the patient had several episodes of tachycardia to 130-140s, with transition to NSVT. Cardiology consult felt this was consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV overnight with good response. However since this was an isolated episode it was not felt that keeping her on amiodarone was necessary at this time.  #Pleural effusions: Patient had chest tube placement with initial high output which eventually tapered off. This was thought likely due to her malignancy. Several days post admission to ICU the patient's chest tube fell out while moving from chair to bed. IP was consulted but did not feel the tube needed to be replaced at that time and serial CXR were indicated to r\/o PTX.  The patient's chest tubes were removed on [**10-24**]. She continued to have signifcant pleural effusions.  # Metastatic ovarian cancer: Patient was followed by the OMED service. The option of chemotherapy was discussed which the patient agreed to a trial of carboplatin. Steroids and antiemetics were given as per oncology protocol during her chemotherapy. Her WBC and fever curve were monitored. She tolerated the course well and was maintained on HD throughout. Tumor lysis labs were followed and allopurinol was started prophylactically. However, given her clinical decline and infections she no longer could tolerate additional treatment.  #Code Status:  The patient was maintained on 3 pressors.  After a multiple family meets and discussions it was decided to withdraw the pressors on [**2138-10-29**].  The patient passed away shortly after at 7:50pm.  "}]
