Diffuse osteopenia.  Right hip\/femur\/tib-fib films [**8-1**]: Oblique comminuted fracture of the distal femur. No clear intra-articular extension noted. Suboptimal visualization of the tibial plateau as above. Severe profound osteopenia.  Right femur intra-op [**8-3**]: 35 fluoroscopic images of the right femur are submitted for dictation. The total intraservice time of 181 seconds. These demonstrate interval placement of a large lateral fracture plate with multiple associated cortical screws. This is fixating an obliquely oriented fracture through the right distal femoral metaphysis. There are no signs for hardware-related complication. Inferior portion of the femoral prosthetic stem is visualized. Please refer to the procedure note for additional details.  CXR [**8-2**]: There is a small left pleural effusion. Calcification of the mitral annulus. The right hilum is prominent and it is unclear if this is projectional or due to vascular engorgement. A hilar mass cannot be totally excluded. Recommend followup. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution suggesting an element of fluid overload. Compared to the prior study the right hilar prominence and fluid overload are increased.  CXR [**8-4**]: Slight improvement of left pleural effusion; hypoinflation but no discrete consolidation.  Video swallow [**8-5**]: 1. Retention of solids\/thick liquids in valleculae. 2. Aspiration of thin liquids.  "}]
