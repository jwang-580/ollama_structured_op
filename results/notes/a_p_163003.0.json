[{"0":" 54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity (s\/p gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. . # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was initially intubated at an OSH following respiratory failure in the setting of increased sedation and PE.  He was intubated and remained intubated upon transfer to rehab.  He was referred for trach\/PEG, but while undergoing the procedure he was found to have a GI bleed and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  On arrive the patient with respiratory failure likely multifactorial including PE, HAP\/aspiration and volume overload. His prior sputum cultures had grown Enterobacter aerogenes and initially treated with Cefepime. However, his abx were changed to vancomycin\/zosyn after repeat CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate.  He completed a 14 day course of Vancomycin\/Zosyn on [**2127-12-26**].  Additionally, given his pulmonary edema he was diuresed with IV lasix.  He was also restarted on his heparin gtt for his prior PE, LENI were negative for DVT. The patient underwent trach and PEG on [**2127-12-26**] and weaned to PS support.  The trach should not be changed for 10 days after placement and if he needed to be re-intubated it should be from above.   The patient was on MMV ventilation on discharge TV 500, RR 6, FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 PSV 12  #. Mental Status:  The patient with limited mental status after his accident and respiratory arrest.  He was AAOx3 and fully functional prior to his accident.  He was evaluated by neurology and underwent an EEG that showed some questional delta activity concerning for seizure.  He was started on phenytoin per neuro. He also underwent an MRI that did not show evidence of anoxic brain injury.  The etiology of his mental status is likely metabolic encephalopathy, but his prognosis is unclear.  The plan is to lighten sedation and assess neurologic status.  Per the wife [**Name (NI) 382**] if he does not have meaningful recovery and ventilator dependent then will likely be transitioned to comfort care.  He will continue Dilantin 100mg TID and levels should be checked.  #Hypotension- Patient initially hypotensive on arrival and on vasopressin.  He was changed over the levophed and it was sucessfully weaned off on [**12-26**].  The patient's hypotension was likely multifactorial including infectious (pneumonia), GIB and sedation.  #LGIB- The patient was noted to have bright red blood per rectum at rehab while on heparin gtt.  His heparin gtt was held and after evaluation at the OSH he was noted to have 7pt Hct drop and received 1U prbcs. Per report, he had EGD and did not find a source of bleeding.  On arrive the the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU he was noted to have brown stool that was guaiac positive, but no further episodes of BRBPR.  The patient was transfused a total of 3U pRBC during his admssion, the most recent on [**12-24**].  Given that the patient did not have any further episodes of bleeding he was restarted on his heparin gtt without further evidence of bleeding.  He was also evaluated by GI and recommended outpatient colonoscopy and follow-up given no evidence of acute bleeding.  #LV Thrombus\/PE: Pt with history of LV thrombus previously on coumadin.  A repeat TTE did not show evidence of LV thrombus. He was transitioned to lovenox on discharge and will need to be started on coumadin.  #H\/o CAD s\/p cardiac arrest [**2114**]: The pateint was continued on his home sotolol.  His aspirin was held given his history of GI bleed.  #DM: The patient was covered with an insulin sliding scale   "}]
