Renal US [**10-27**]: essentially normal. small 8mm AML upper pole L kidney .  CXR [**10-27**]: Two views of the chest demonstrate the lungs to be clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. . . CXR [**10-24**]: The lung volumes are lower on the current study. There is extensive bilateral perihilar new interstitial prominence as well as newly developed left retrocardiac opacity that might be a progression of pre-demonstrated abnormality on [**2159-10-22**] radiograph suggesting worsening of infection in combination with pulmonary edema. Followup of the patient after diuresis is recommended to evaluate the relationship between suspected infection and pulmonary edema changes. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable . CXR [**10-22**] IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation identified. . Echo: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal LV cavity size and normal systolic function. There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation - there is mild bileaflet prolapse. There may be a partial flail of the posterior leaflet (images # 1 and 2). The RV is mildly dilated\/hypokinetic. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. . RUQ U\/S ([**10-22**]): wet read: gb collapsed with possible air (linear hyperechoic foci with dirty shadowing) although stone could have similar appearance- less likely given no stone on recent outside CT images. possible air within left lobe of liver. no bil dil. DDx includes recent procedure or possible biliary enteric fistula. emphysematous cholecystitis could also present with gb air, however there is no inflammatory changes\/wall edema or gb distention. . . ERCP [**10-24**]: Impression: Normal major papilla. No evidence of a biliary enteric fistula An air pneumogram was seen on the scout image. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification  A distal CBD filling defect consistent with a small stone was seen at the biliary tree. There was no post-obstructive dilation A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Multiple stone fragments were extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon. The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure (sphincterotomy, stone extraction) Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum Note that there was no pus in the bile duct - it is not clear that biliary sepsis is the cause of his recurrent fevers - consider other causes . .
