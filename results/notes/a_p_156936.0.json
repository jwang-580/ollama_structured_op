[{"0":" 74F with diastolic CHF, bipolar, dementia preseneds with hypoxemia. She was initially admitted from home to [**Hospital6 5505**] on [**2123-12-13**] for UTI and acute renal failure which resolved with IVF. She was discharged to [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital on [**2123-12-15**]. Soon after arrival to the [**Doctor First Name 1191**] she was noted to be in respiratory distress with O2sat 92% on 2L and she was transferred back to St. Es. The patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER O2 sats were in the 70s requiring NRB. She was initially admitted to the ICU and transferred to the floor after improvement in her respiratory status. The following is her course by problem.  # Aspiration vs. Health Care Associated Pneumonia\/Respiratory distress and hypoxia: With elevated WBC#, CXR findings and markedly increased secretions in a patient with recent altered mental status and pre-existing dysphagia most concerning was health care associated pneumonia due to aspiration event. Lower likelihood for CHF exacerbation given lack of ischemic EKG changes and patient was markedly volume depleted on exam. Ventilation likely challenged by marked restrictive physiology from kyphosis.   Due to low 02 sats, the patient was amitted to the MICU.  The patient was started on Vanco\/Zosyn\/Levofloaxacin.  A sputum culture, urine legionella antibody were drawn.  She was weaned from a non-rebreather overnight to 4LNC.  In the morning, levofloxacin was d\/c'd as no indication for covering for atypicals (no cavitation in CXR and no witnessed aspiration event).  Urine legionella was negative.  Patient was too somnolent in evening for nursing to do trial of swallow so she remained NPO on maintanence fluids.  Patient continued to improve and was able to wean to 3 LNC upon transfer to the floor. This was finally weaned down to 97% 2 L NC. Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued to complete a 7 day course. . # Aspiration\/Failure to Thrive\/Goals of care: Pt has known history of aspiration per Swallow eval [**3-30**]. Per family, she has had a decline in being able to perform ADLs at home over the past year, with significant weight loss over the past year. It is felt by pts physicians and her family that the pt has had an eating disorder her entire life. Discussed the idea of tubefeeding with pt, husband, and several daughters. We discussed that tubefeeding will not decrease risk of aspiration, and will not prolong life, would not bring functional status back to baseline, and may only temporarily help with nutrition. Pt finds much joy in eating, and expresses that she would not want to stop eating. Pt at this time is capable of making her own decisions. Speech and swallow saw pt and performed video swallow eval, which showed aspiration with nectar thickened liquids, but not with honey thickened liquids. Speech and swallow recommended a diet of honey thickened liquids, ground solids, whole pills with puree, and ensure pudding. Geriatrics was consulted to further discuss goals of care with pt and her family. We addressed pros and cons of tubefeeding with family, and we felt that the pt clearly stated she did not want a feeding tube. Given the family's orthodox [**Hospital1 **] religion which advocates for all life-sustaining measures, we explained that in this circumstance a feeding tube will not prolong pts life and may cause suffering.We felt pt has reached a level of decline which is not much reversible, even with tubefeeds. Geriatrics provided family literature to read about tubefeeding from the perspective of [**Hospital1 **] faith. We also addressed code status, because as of now pt is FULL CODE. Family understands that this could be detrimental for pt, and will further discuss code status after discharge. In addition, we discussed long term care, and pts husband did seem to agree that pt needs long term care as he can no longer care for pt at home. . # Delirium\/Dementia: CT head from SEM was reviewed and no abnormalities were noted.  We held all sedating medications.  We also noted the patient was hypernatremic, so we treated her hypoxia, hypernatremia and gave her maintenence fluids w\/d5 and her mental status improved so that she could answer appropriately. On the evening of [**12-19**] the pt had delirium through the night, which resolved by morning. UA neg for UTI and C diff negative.  On [**12-21**], pt was at her mental status baseline, alert, oriented x3, and interactive. . # Hypernatremia: volume depleted based on increased BUN and Hct compared to baseline and free water depleted. Estimated free water deficit was ~1L.  Hypernatremic to 149, D5 1\/2 NS @ 150 ml\/hr => rechecked lated and Na still 149 so changed fluids to D5W @ 150cc\/hr. In the AM, was decreased to 75\/hr in the AM for concern for her diastolic CHD (mild to moderate on ECHO), with sodium normalizing. .  # Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb trended up to 40 on [**12-20**]. Pt was confused overnight, so CO2 retention was possible. ABG however was consistent with a primary metabolic alkalosis. She had no hypokalemia at this time or NG tube to explain met. alkalosis. Seemed to be volume replete as BUN has trended down with IVF. BIcarb trended back down to 37 on its own. . # Bipolar Disorder\/Depresssion: Records in chart are unclear, but pt had been transferred from [**Hospital **] to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Hospital 96435**] Hospital, and there is documentation of Section 12 in chart. Discharge summary from [**Hospital 2940**] does not mention any psychiatric issue, section 12, or transfer to psych facility. Discussed pt with her psychiatrist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who states pt to his knowledge has not had any recent  psychiatric decompensation. It is felt pt was likely sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital per request of family, became acutely ill on arrival, never was assessed there, and was sent back to [**Hospital **] on section 12. In the hospitalist's opinion while pt was here, pt was stable from a psychiatric standpoint. She was restarted on zyprexa, but of note pt's neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] recommended it be stopped as he feels it has been ineffective. Pts family did not feel comfortable stopping this medication until further discussed with pt's psychiatrist. Will continue zyprexa for now. . # Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: LVEF >75%. Severely hypovolemic on exam.  Patient's lasix was held while her volume was repleted, as was her lisinopril. Given her poor nutritional status, would not restart these medications. . # Hypertension: Lasix and lisinopril were both held in the setting of poor po intake, hypernatremia. Her SBP was up to the 170s, but pt refused to start norvasc or any other BP medications. Given her life expectancy\/goals of care, this was felt to be reasonable. . #Sacral pressure ulcer: stage I and unstageable region as well.  - frequent repositioning and padding of area - nutritional support as able      "}]
