[{"0":" 52 yo F transferred here on [**4-19**] intubated from OSH for possible tracheal stent placement given tracheal compression [**2-9**] to large left sided small cell lung tumor, metastatic to liver.  Had received chemotherapy at the OSH on [**4-21**] (carboplatin and etoposide).  She was admitted initially to the ICU and underwent bronchoscopy found to have 80% stenosis of RUL bronchus.  No intervention undertaken.  SVC found to be completely occluded and stent was placed with excellent effect.  Additionally, patient found to have R subclavian thrombus.  She was initially treated with heparin and transitioned to and discharged on lovenox. Echo on [**4-21**] revealed severely depressed EF of 20% presumed to be from myocarditis - viral vs. chemotherapy induced.  Repeat echo one week on [**4-28**] showed slight improvement to 20-25%.  She was treated with ACEi and BB for non-decompensated heart failure. Patient also underwent 160cc thoracentsis of R pleural effusion and received empiric treatment for pneumonia which was completed prior to transfer to floor. She was successfully extubated and transferred to the floor.  On the floor patient became pancytopenic as expected 10 days post-chemotherapy administration.  Her respiratory status improved and she was successfully weaned off of oxygen though she remained short of breath (though not hypoxic) with ambulation more than 10 yards.  She was monitored for several days to ensure increase in counts which started to trend back up towards normal and she was discharged in stable condition on room air home with services on lovenox.  Per patient preference, she will follow up with oncology at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital.   "}]
