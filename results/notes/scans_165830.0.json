There is no comparison. The right PICC line terminates at the atriocaval junction, in satisfactory position. There is minimal left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.  [**2147-4-21**] Abd US: 1. Extremely echogenic liver consistent with the history of liver disease. Ascites in three of four quadrants. 2. Patent portal vein, but with reversal of flow (hepatofugal).  [**2147-4-29**] CT ABDOMEN\/PELVIS w\/o contrast: 1. Large left rectus abdominis wall fluid collection, suggestive of hematoma. Given lack of contrast, abscess is not excluded. No retroperitoneal hematoma is identified, however blood may be present in extraperitoneal space. 2. Diffuse colonic wall thickening highly suggestive of colitis\/edema.  Differential considerations include primarily infectious (C. diff should be considered given patient's ICU status), inflammatory causes, and much less likely ischemic colitis. 3. Perihepatic and right lower quadrant ascites with diffuse fat stranding throughout the mesentery, consisent with volume overload. 4. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly greater on the left when compared to the right with scattered opacities. 5. Mild cardiomegaly. 6. Gastric post-surgical changes.  [**2147-4-30**] R Lower exrremity ultrasound: REASON FOR EXAM: Status post right femoral line placement. Clinical concern for hematoma. ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF THE RIGHT GROIN: This study is minimally limited due to a bandage overlying the right groin. No definite hematoma was visualized. The right common femoral artery and vein demonstrate normal color and Doppler flow. There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.  [**2147-5-1**]: INDICATION: 44-year-old female with liver failure, DIC, right upper extremity swelling. Evaluate for DVT. IMPRESSION: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.  [**2147-5-8**] CXR 2 view: The position of the Dobbhoff catheter is unchanged and satisfactory. Multifocal consolidation remains unchanged with no newly developed areas of consolidation.  [**2147-5-8**] Abd US: 1. Echogenic liver consistent with history of liver disease. 2. Slow and reversal flow in the main portal vein. Reversal flow in the left portal vein. 3. Sufficient fluid to mark site for paracentesis. 4. Extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation, and mild intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.  [**5-15**] Liver biopsy pathology: Liver, transjugular needle core biopsy: 1.  Nodular fragments of hepatic parenchyma and broad fibrous septal tissue, consistent with cirrhosis (trichrome stain evaluated; a focal sinusoidal fibrotic component is identified). 2.  Mild, mixed steatosis (involving <33% of the parenchyma), with prominent associated intracytoplasmic hyalin. 3.  Moderate septal and lobular mixed inflammation with a marked neutrophilic component. 4.  Moderate canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis. 5.  Iron stain shows mild iron deposition in periportal hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Note:  The findings are consistent with an acute-on-chronic toxic\/metabolic injury.  No diagnostic features of autoimmune hepatitis are identified in this limited sample. Discussed with pathologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7017**] - While prednisone will affect the histologic appearance of autoimmune hepatitis and she does have robust [**Doctor First Name **], her [**Last Name (un) 15412**] is low titer and Ig levels being low also argues against autoimmune hepatitis.  [**5-16**] EGD: No varices noted. Previous gastric bypass noted, dobhoff tube in place. No stigmata of bleeding. No stigmata of bleeding. Otherwise normal EGD to duodenum\/jejunum  [**2147-5-19**] Uncomplicated conversion of temporary hemodialysis catheter to a tunneled hemodialysis catheter, in the right jugular vein; tip-to-cuff length is 19 cm; tip is in the right atrium; the line is ready for use.
