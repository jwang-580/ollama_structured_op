[{"0":" MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] with and without contrast- [**2139-1-21**]- Nodular subependymal enhancement corresponding to FLAIR and T2 abnormality. The main differential consideration is lymphomatous infiltration. Small vessel chronic ischemia may co-exist.  EEG- [**2139-1-20**]- This is an abnormal routine EEG due to intermittent left temporal theta slowing and right temporal sharp waves. These findings suggest subcortical dysfunction on the left and cortical irritability on the right in the temporal regions. No electrographic seizures were noted during this recording.  CSF - [**2139-1-22**] WBC 2, RBC 2, Protein 54, Glucose 98 LDH 87 Gram Stain Negative Culture negative Cytology: Rare atypical cells in a background of mature lymphocytes and monocytes. Protein electrophoresis (SPEP): No oligoclonal bands VZV PCR negative Cryptococcal Ag negative [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus negative  EKG ([**2139-1-25**]): Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Prominent QRS voltage suggests left ventricular hypertrophy, although it is non-diagnostic. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy but clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2138-12-16**] sinus tachycardia is now present and QRS voltage is less prominent.  Renal US ([**2139-1-27**]): No hydronephrosis. Linear calcifications within the transplant kidney may represent non-obstructive calculi.  CXR ([**2139-1-19**]): No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  CXR ([**2139-1-24**]): Pending  CXR ([**2139-1-25**]): In comparison with the study of [**1-19**], respiratory motion somewhat degrades the image. The heart is normal in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia. Broken sternal wires are again seen.  CXR ([**2139-1-27**]): Left lung is clear. There could be a small region of new opacification at the base of the right lung above the elevated right hemidiaphragm, probably mild atelectasis or superimposition of normal structures. There are no abnormalities convincing for pneumonia. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal on the right. Heart size is normal. Incidental note is made of possible acute fracture of the left eighth rib more obvious on the chest radiograph from [**1-25**], and distortion of the right seventh rib posterolaterally that looks more like a healed fracture.  CXR ([**2139-1-27**]): NG appropriately placed. . [**2138-2-13**] CXR-FINDINGS: Improvement in degree of pulmonary edema with residual perihilar haziness. An asymmetric area of alveolar consolidation in the right infrahilar region. The latter may be due to a resolving area of asymmetrical edema, but infection is also possible in the appropriate setting. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally as well as atelectatic changes in the left retrocardiac area. . LENI [**2-15**]-IMPRESSION: No DVT identified within bilateral lower extremities. . CXR [**2-17**]-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The pre-existing right basal opacity is less dense but slightly more extensive.  The pre-existing left retrocardiac opacity has completely resolved. There is no evidence of interval occurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  .   "}]
