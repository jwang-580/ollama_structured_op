FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2142-9-8**]):    NO GROWTH. VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.  CXR [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. Overall, however, no acute pulmonary process is identified. CT head [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: Relatively stable head CT examination compared with [**2142-6-14**]. No CT evidence of acute cortical stroke or hemorrhage. Incidental findings as above. MRI head [**2142-8-30**] IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter indicate extensive changes of small vessel disease, which have progressed since the previous MRI of [**2136-10-19**]. 2. Ventriculomegaly and prominence of temporal horns which in presence of choroidal fissure widening is secondary to atrophy. 3. Chronic blood products in the left cerebellum indicate previous hemorrhage with bilateral small chronic cerebellar infarcts. 4. No evidence of acute infarct seen. 5. No evidence of abnormal parenchymal enhancement.  [**9-6**] MRI head FINDINGS: Extensive periventricular and subcortical hyperintensities are identified with moderate ventriculomegaly and prominence of temporal horns. Hyperintensities are also seen in the pons and middle cerebellar peduncles. There is an area of chronic blood products in the left cerebellum. There is no acute infarct seen. No midline shift identified. Coronal images demonstrate bilateral hippocampal atrophy with widening of the choroidal fissures. No intrinsic signal abnormalities are seen within the hippocampus. The hyperintensity seen on the superior aspect of the right hippocampus appears to be due to enhancement of the choroid plexus as the FLAIR images appear to have been obtained following gadolinium administration. Coronal MP-RAGE images demonstrate no evidence of abnormal parenchymal enhancement. There is mild diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement seen, which is a nonspecific finding and could be related to prior lumbar puncture. IMPRESSION: 1.
