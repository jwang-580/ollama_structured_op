[{"0":" MICU Course: Dr.[**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. This was felt to be flash pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension with BPs 220s\/130s. He was maintained on Bipap. Fluid was removed via HD. He was initially placed on nitro gtt for BP control. His BP regimen was changed by increasing his metoprolol to 50 TID, adding back his home amlodipine 10mg and adding hydral. He had been on an ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] at home which were held for [**Last Name (un) **]. His CEs were stable. Other chantges: Keppra redosed for HD. No MTX yet. LENIs negative. Renal and onc coordintating. Continues to be lethargic. Responds to questions by noding head yes or no.  NEUROLOGY: Altered Mental Status - Upon presentation, Dr. [**Known lastname **] had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] level of orientation, frequently talking as if his daydreams were reality. Focal exam deficits included impairment of downward gaze, right facial droop, right arm and leg weakness. MRI with contrast was concerning for metastatic lymphoma.  Infectious causes were also initially in the differential, especially CMV; however, the infectious work-up was negative. Toxic\/Metabolic work-up was negative. Uremic encephalopathy not likely in setting or low-for-pt BUN and Cr as well as continued hemodialysis. Ultimately, the patient was transferred to the BMT service. He was given a cycle of intravenous methotrexate and Rituxan. After this treatment, his mental status was monitored and his mental status did not improve, and ultimately he was made comfort measures only and passed away in the hospital.  Seizures - Given concern that the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status could suggest seizures, EEG was initially obtained and revealed intermittent L temporal theta slowing and R temporal sharp waves, but no seizure activity on EEG.  On [**1-24**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] had several episodes of unresponsiveness to voice and reports of left leg and arm shaking, clinically concerning for seizure. He was started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and the episodes appear to have resolved at the time of transfer to the BMT service.  CNS Lymphoma - After the MRI with contrast raised concern for metastatic lymphoma, a follow-up LP was performed.  This showed 2 WBC, insufficent for determination of clonality. Cytology demonstrated a few atypical lymphocytes.  SPEP showed no oligoclonal bands.  Beta-2 microglobulin was noted to be elevated in the CSF..  Intrathecal methotrexate was considered but neuro-oncology expressed concern that this would not adequately reach the subependymal region where the metastatses were seen.  The option for IV methotrexate was discussed extensively with the family, and they expressed interest. He was ultimately transferred to the BMT service, where he was given a cycle of intravenous methotrexate. He subsequently received leucovorin and hemodialysis to minimize methotrexate toxicity. He had a transaminitis most likely from the methotrexate which resolved. He was given leucovorin until the methotrexate levels in his blood were undectable.  Shingles - On [**1-22**], Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed a rash in the right C3-C5 distribution ending midline. Derm was consulted and suspected Shingles; DFA which was positive for VZV in setting of immunosuppression. Dr. [**Known lastname **] was then started on renal dose acyclovir, briefly switched to famciclovir and then ultimately ganciclovir per ID recommendations, to cover CMV as well as VZV.  On [**1-26**], given concern for bacterial suprainfection, vancomycin was started per hemodialysis protocol, with all doses given during dialysis. He was continued on vancomycin until....  UTI - Initial urine culture showed mixed flora, and UA was negative.  Dr. [**Known lastname **] developed fevers during admission and repeat urine studies revealed E. Coli (>100,000 colonies, pan-sensitive except to Bactrim) and Enterococcus (10,000-100,000 colonies).  This was initially treated with ceftriaxone ([**1-26**]), and then switched to cefepime ([**1-27**]) in the context of bacteremia (see below), per ID recs.  ID also recommended a renal ultrasound to check for GU reflux in the context of oliguria; demonstrated no hydronephrosis.  They also recommended considering abdominal CT to further evaluate the kidneys if renal ultrasound was unrevealing......  Bacteremia \/ Fevers - Blood culture [**1-25**] grew gram-negative rods, pan-sensitive.  As noted above, Dr. [**Known lastname **] had been started on Ceftriaxone ([**1-26**]) and later switched to Cefepime ([**1-27**]).   On [**1-30**], he was noted to have a fever. CXR was performed but did not show evidence of an acute lung process. He was placed on cefepime\/flagyl. Flagyl was eventually stopped on [**2-4**], per ID recommendations......  ESRD- Dr. [**Known lastname **] has ESRD s\/p transplant now with failing graft. He was started back on HD in [**Month (only) 1096**] for concern for uremic encephalopathy. We continued his hemodialysis regimen (Monday\/Wednesday\/Friday) as well as his Prednisone and Bactrim prophylaxis. He was dialyzed twice in 24 hours post-Gad administration for his MRI. After he received cycle 1 of methotrexate, he was dialyzed on several consecutive days to aid in methotrexate clearance....  NSVT - Dr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have 10-12 beat runs of VTach on telemetry, which seemed to coincide with seizure activity. CK was WNL and Troponin 0.08 in setting of renal failure.  The episodes appeared to resolve once Keppra was on board......  Rib Fracture - CXR did show what appeared to be an acute rib fracture of the 8th rib and an older fracture of the 7th rib. There was no history of rib fractures, and the patient does not appear to be in pain from this......  Pressure Ulcers - Dr. [**Known lastname **] has two sacral pressure ulcers which are being monitored by the wound consult nurse.......  "}]
