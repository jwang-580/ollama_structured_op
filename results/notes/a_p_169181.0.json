[{"0":" Mr. [**Known lastname 20113**] is an 87 year old Russian-speaking man with a PMH significant for CAD s\/p inferior non-Q wave MI, s\/p CVA in [**2171**] with right eye vision loss, DMII, hyperlipidemia, & HTN who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 **] with 1 day h\/o weakness, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever. . # Shortness of breath\/weakness\/low-grade fever: Patient with 1 day of shortness of breath and weakness\/numbness in his feet and hands leading to 2 mechanical falls at home in the past 24 hours. Patient reports little appetite, poor PO's x 2 days. No other localizing symptoms. On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], FSG was 40. Normal Gap,  lactate, WBC. Patient did have low grade fever intermittently that resolved with Tylenol. No consolidation on CXR. Blood and urine culture were negative. This may represent viral infection causing low grade fever, poor PO's and shortness of breath.  Furthermore, given his CXR finding of hyperinflation and smoking history, it is likely that patient has COPD that hasn't been diagnosed.  Patient has no PFT in our system, and has never seen a pulmonologist.  Patient was given standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs during this hospital stay.  Also, given the history of \"shortness of breath leading to feeling of impending doom\" that finally came out when Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] talked to the patient in Russian without family presence, PE was also on the differential.  D-dimer elevated at 1380. LENIS and V\/Q scan were done, which showed no DVT or PE.  TTE was also done which showed no significant changes compared to the TTE done last year. PT evaluated the patient and determined that he required [**Hospital 3058**] rehab. The family and patient declined, despite the medical team's recommendation, so the patient was sent home with PT and assurances that the patient would not be left unattended or get up by himself at home. . # CAD w\/ Elevated CK & Troponins: Patient with long-standing h\/o CAD and an inferior MI in [**2165**] (Cath from [**2165**] demonstrated 2VD, 40% occlusion proximal LAD, 95% stenosis of mid & distal L [**Name (NI) **], PTCA of OM1). Now, patient with weakness, shortness of breath, elevated CE's with Troponin of 1.51 on admission & report of Troponin I of 9.08 at OSH. His last exercise stress test was negative in [**2169**]. Patient had no chest pain, chest pressure, discomfort in arm or jaw . While CK, CK-MB, Troponin are all elevated, MBI is not elevated, EKG unconcerning for ACS. Elevated enzymes may represent a myositis or injury after his fall. CK eventually came down. Statin was held given elevated CK levels.  Patient was continued to metoprolol and aspirin. . # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Patient with known stage III-IV CKD. A GFR was 34 in [**3-\/2179**] (baseline Cr 1.7-2.1), Cr on admission 2.5. Etiology likely pre-renal given clinical history of poor PO's x 2 days, which was confirmed by urine lytes. Patient was given a 500cc NS bolus on admission, and was then encouraged to take POs. ACEI and lasix were held initially given acute renal failure.  Creatinine down-trended as a result.  On discharge, his creatinine was at his baseline 2.0. . # Hypertension: Patient with long-standing, previously uncontrolled blood pressures causing CKD & hemorrhagic CVA in [**2171**]. Recent blood pressures per [**Hospital **] clinic visits appear to be well-controlled with sbp's in the 120's. Blood pressure on admission elevated with sbp's in 140's in the context of shortness of breath, now sbp's of 120's-140's on the floor. ACEI and Lasix were held initially given acute renal failure. Metorpolol and Nifedipine were continued.  Patient's BP was well-controlled during this admission. He was restarted on his ACE at discharge, but his Lasix was held until follow-up with his PCP next week. . # PUMP: Patient with shortness of breath on admission, requiring 4L NC. Most recent ECHO in [**3-\/2179**] revealed EF of 50% along with 1+ AR and trivial MR. CXR negative for effusions, congestion, or cardiomegaly. He did not not appear fluid overloaded on exam and without elevation of JVP or S3, despite mild R basilar crackles & chronic mild pedal edema. Repeat TTE showed no significant changes compared to the TTE done last year. . # RHYTHM: Patient with no prior h\/o arrhythmia. Out of concern for persistent unexplained chest pain, patient had a Holter Monitor device in [**2171**] that was negative for any arrythmia. Patient was observed on tele which showed no significant abnormalities.  Patient was on metoprolol during this hospital stay. . # DMII: Patient takes Glyburide 2.5mg PO daily at home. Given episode of hypoglycemia on admission in context of poor PO's and impaired renal function, glyburide was held, and patient was on Humalog ISS for glucose control.  Patient's glucose was well-controlled during this hospital stay. . # Hyperlipidemia: Patient's statin was held given elevated CK. He will not restart until he sees his PCP in [**Name Initial (PRE) **]\/u next week. . # Chronic back & shoulder pain: Patient s\/p L4-S1 laminectomy\/L5-S1 discectomy & L rotator cuff repair with long-standing bilateral shoulder arthritis, low back DJD, sciatica, and resulting numbness in his toes. Walks with the assistance of a walker for leg fatigue. Patient has been seen by pain management in [**2175**] and prescribed Vicodin & Tizanadine, but did not follow-up and per more recent OMR records, has not continued to take these medications. Neurologic exam demonstrates 4\/5 strength in iliopsoas bilaterally that patient's family estimates is patient's baseline.  Patient received tylenol for pain control. . # FEN: Patient received cardiac heart healthy\/diabetic\/renal diet.  He tolerated POs well. . # PROPHYLAXIS: Patient received heparin sc for DVT prophylaxis.  . # CODE: FULL CODE . # COMM: [**Name (NI) **] & patient's wife, son and daughter-in-law.  Of note, interpreter service was used to gather more accurate history from patient, but the family was providing most of the history even when the interpreter was present.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] was able to gather more history from the patient when speaking to patient directly in Russian in the absence of family.   "}]
