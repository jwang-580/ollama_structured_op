Findings suggestive of fluid overload, with small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with hilar fullness in the visualized lung bases. 2. Nodular contour of the liver, which can be seen with cirrhosis, with a small amount of ascites. 3. Rounded hypodensities in the right lobe of the liver are incompletely characterized without intravenous contrast. 4. Cystic structure inferior to the third portion of the duodenum. This is of uncertain etiology with differential diagnostic considerations including a fluid-filled normal bowel loop, duplication cyst, and duodenal diverticulum. . =========== Cardiology =========== C. Cath [**2124-7-11**] 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent CAD. 2. An 8Fr 30cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted via a right common femoral artery with good diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries are normal. 2. Cardiogenic shock. 3. Insertion of IABP. . TTE [**2124-7-11**] Mild [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. LV wall thicknesses normal. LV mildly dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). Restrictive left ventricular filling pattern suggestive of severe diastolic dysfunction. RV is dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Normal aortic valve. 3 + MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] htn. . TTE [**2124-7-14**] On IABP: There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). RV with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial\/physiologic pericardial effusion. Off IABP: Overall LV systolic function remains severely depressed with some subtle increased systolic thickening of the anterior and lateral LV segments (LVEF 25-30%). The degree of mitral regurgitation increased to moderate to severe (3+). Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-7-11**], overall LV systolic function appears slightly improved and the degree of MR less   "}]
