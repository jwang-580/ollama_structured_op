[**2-20**] ekg: Normal sinus rhythm. Within normal limits. Moderate artifact makes measuring the P-R interval difficult but it seems to be slightly prolonged. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2143-1-22**] no diagnostic interval change. . [**2-20**] CT abd: 1. Diverticulosis. No evidence of diverticulitis. 2. Ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion within segment IV B of the liver is unchanged dating back to [**2136**]. 3. Degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine, with grade I anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, unchanged. 4. Unchanged renal cysts. . [**2-20**] CXR: AP and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Lungs are clear bilaterally demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly normal. Osseous structures are intact. No free air is seen below the diaphragm. . [**2-21**] CXR: Picc line terminating in mid SVC. No PTX. . [**2-21**] CT head: No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute large vascular territory infarction. . [**2-21**] foot xray: No bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis. . [**2-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L\/min\/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular global and regional systolic function. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.   "}]
