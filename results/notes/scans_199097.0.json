[**2185-3-6**] PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no heart failure and no pneumonia. . [**3-7**] Echo: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml\/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  IMPRESSION: There is left to right shunting across the inter-atrial septum seen on color Doppler. After injection of saline and with the Valsalva maneuver, a few bubbles can be seen in the right atrium (likely not a large number as left to right shunting prohibits passage). Moderate LV dilatation with moderate global hypokinesis (the inferolateral segments have the worst function). The right ventricle appears mildly dilated\/hypokinetic. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  . TEE pending at time of discharge  "}]
