[{"0":" 56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5622**] chromosome ALL s\/p allogeneic transplant s\/p DLI in remission with subsequent severe GVHD who on this admission underwent thoracotomy for empyema. . DEATH SUMMARY: Pt was initially admitted for complicated empyema for which she was treated with 3 chest tubes and antibiotics by the SICU team prior to transfer to the medical floor.  Her empyema was complicated by gram negative rod bacteremia and gram negatives found on BAL.  Both her empyema and bacteremia were treated with meropenem.  Meropenem was kept on long after finishing treatment for empyema & bacteremia because of concern for infection given that she still had 3 chest tubes in place. Thoracics was removing her chest tubes over time and her second tube was removed 2 days prior to her transfer to the ICU.  CXRs were obtained after every adjustment of her chest tubes.  Her pain was controlled with IV morphine sulfate with a continuous basal amount through a PCA and PO morphine sulfate for breakthrough pain. . From an infectious point of view, meropenem was ultimately stopped because the patient developed c diff which resolved quickly on oral vancomycin.  She was later started on levofloxacin for treatment of a UTI.  Because she had ALL and was in remission she was continued on her acyclovir, inhaled pentamidine, and micofungin (she had previously been on caspofungin but this was discontinued in the setting of rising LFTs).  Her GVHD was likely repsponsible for her rising LFTs and her steroid dose was adjusted during her hospital stay.  Her cellcept dose was also increased.  Concern for fungal infection in he setting of her LFTs prompted an MRI of the abdomen which showed no fungal infection. . She was transfused both blood and platelets during her hospital course. Her metoprolol dose was adjusted to treat her worsening HTN in the setting of her increased dose of cellcept.  Her diet was slowly advanced since she had severe dysphagia and a hoarse voice after her intubation. She was seen regularly by both physical therapy and speech\/swallow. . The patient was improving markedly and the plan was for her final chest tube to be pulled, her diet to be advanced, and to soon be discharged. Earlier in the day of her event the patient was walking with her walker accompanied by her husband.  After sitting down for a while she suddenly complained of shortness of breath and the nurse placed her on 2L nasal canula for comfort despite a normal oxygen saturation.  The nurse then turned around to find her slumped over and leaning towards the left. At this time the patient was complaining of a headache.  Upon entering the room the medicine intern noted her head to be slumped over to the left.  The patient was communicating normally and reported a headache. Mrs. [**Known lastname 52383**] was found to have left sided hemiparesis and left sided loss of sensation on very brief physical exam.  A stat CXR was ordered due to concern of worsening PTX given the patient reported tachypnea (this CXR was read as not changed from prior).  A code stroke was called and the attending physician was immediately informed and at the patient's bedside.  She was rushed to the CT scanner where she required Ativan due to starting to seize. . A CTA of the head was obtained that ultimately showed gas within the intracranial venous sinuses and cortical veins, the right internal jugular vein just above the venous catheter entry site, and the right internal carotid artery.  The CT perfusion study also showed extensive multifocal cerebral edema and enhancement. After confirmation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] that the patient had stopped seizing, an MRI and MRV were also obtained.  They showed extensive multifocal cortical swelling (right greater than left) with ishemia and possible infarction which was likely related to cortical venous air embolism which is demonstrated on the concurrent head CTA. . In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], neurology was consulted to follow the pt with the ICU team.  On the morning prior to her passing she was noted to have 4cm and fixed pupils that were non-reactive, roving eye movements, and Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing. Following the presence of increased Cheynne-[**Doctor Last Name **] and apneic episodes concerns for airway protection prompted an intubation. Several hours following intubation she was noted to have fully dilated and fixed bilateral pupils.  Due to concern of tonsillar herniation she was rushed for a CT head. The CT of the head showed extensive multifocal infarctions with dramatic increase in cerebral edema, new herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, and leftward subfalcine herniation. A family meeting was held with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], ICU team, and Neurology.  Given her situation, the decision was made by family for comfort measures only. The family decided to keep the patient intubated in order to allow time for her son to fly in to [**Name (NI) 86**].  The patient died with her family at her bedside.  "}]
