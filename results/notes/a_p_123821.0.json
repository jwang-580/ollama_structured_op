[{"0":" Brief Hospital Course By Problem: [**Name (NI) **] is a 79 year old female with a PMH significant for DM, HTN, and RAD who presented with symptoms of fatigue and nausea, found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **], who was initially admitted to the MICU for management of her multiple medical problems. . #) Anion gap metabolic acidosis: at the time of admission, patient had been complaining of fatigue for 5-7 days prior to presentation, it was unclear if the fatigue and malaise was due to a possible infection given left shift on differential.  The initial concern was that her overall fatigue and malaise led to decreased po intake causing dehydration, which caused poor perfusion and lactate production.  On admission her lactate was found to be 5.5, she was aggressively volume resuscitated with 4L of NS in the ER and over the next day her lactate decreased to 2.1 then to 1.7, and her anion gap closed.  The lactic acidosis was also likely exacerbated by continued administration of metformin prior to her presentation to the hospital.  Her chestx-ray had shown a possible RLL PNA, so she was empirically treated with levaquin.  After closure of her initial anion gap, symptomatically she felt much better, and was able to tolerate po intake and maintain hydration without further IV fluid supplementation. . #) Bradycardia: on presentation to the ER patient had an episode of bradycardia, with a HR in the 40's for about one hour.  The EKG looked like it was junctional, and her potassium was found to be 5.9, peaked at 6.8, which was thought to be the likely cause.  The initial episode resolved, she was monitored on telemetry with no further episodes of bradycardia. . #) Hypotension: on admission found to have systolic blood pressures in the 80's to 90's, her blood pressure responded to aggressive fluid resuscitation, and her outpatient medications were held.  During her hospital stay, her blood pressure medications continued to be held, and at the time of discharge no anti-hypertensives had been restarted as her SBP's had been mostly in the 120's to 130's.  On discharge her daughter was instructed to check her mother's blood pressure daily and if the SBP was greater than 140, she should restart her enalapril.  She was also scheduled for outpatient follow up with her PCP for further BP medication titration. . #) Hyperkalemia: on admission, found to have K=5.9 which then increased and peaked at 6.8.  Thought to be due to decreased po intake leading to [**Last Name (un) **] with concurrent ACEi administration. Potassium normalized the morning of [**10-16**], and remained in the normal range for the remainder of her hospitalization, as her renal function improved.  Her potassium was 4.5 on discharge. . #) SOB\/Wheezing: patient initially complained of shortness of breath, which was thought to be due to her longstanding reactive airway disease, especially since she had recently been told by her PCP to decrease her albuterol neb use.  Initial chest x-ray concerning for a possible pneumonia, so she was started on a 7 day course of levaquin, her sputum culture was contaminated, blood cultures with no growth to date.  She also received albuterol and atrovent nebs every 4 hours as needed with improvement in her respiratory symptoms.  There was also concern for a possible cardiac source of SOB, as she had a an enlarged heart with mild pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, so she an echocardiogram (full report above), that was concerning for an infiltrative process, and was set up with outpatient follow up. . #) Troponin Leak: troponins were checked on [**10-15**], found to be 0.18, cardiology was consulted who felt that since the EKG did not have any significant changes, it was likely demand ischemia in setting of hypovolemia.  Also, they felt that her current acute kidney injury was contributing to the elevated troponin. Troponins trended down over the next 2 days.  A fasting lipid panel was checked, she was started on an 81mg aspirin, her pravastatin was to be restarted on discharge after her transminases normalized.  An echocardiogram was done to further assess the function of her heart, and it showed an EF=30-35%, with concern for an infiltrative process particularly amyloid, so an SPEP was sent, and she was set up with outpatient cardiology follow up. . #) [**Last Name (un) **]: patient with baseline Cr=1.5, on admission found to have Cr of 2.1, her creatinine improved quickly with hydration, making the cause likely prerenal, due to decreased po intake and dehydration.  On discharge patient's creatinine was 1.2, which was lower than her prior baseline measurements. . #) Diabetes Mellitus Type II: initial hyperglycemia to the 400's on admission, sugars also decreased with IV fluid resuscitation.  Her oral medications were discontinued on admission and she was started on a humalog sliding scale.  With reintroduction of a diabetic diet, her blood sugars ranged between 140's to 190's. Her glipizide was restarted the day prior to discharge, but her metformin was discontiued and not restarted given her recent lactic acidosis and baseline creatinine in the 1.4 to 1.5 range.  She was discharged on 10mg of glipizide with outpatient follow up for further blood sugar titration. . #) Left Shoulder Pain: chronic based on history, normal amylase and lipase, used tylenol for pain control.
