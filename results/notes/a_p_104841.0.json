[{"0":" # A fib with RVR:  As the patient had a history of WPW with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with antidromic preexcitation in [**2107-1-7**], we refrained from using verapamil and digoxin as could have promoted conduction down the accessory pathway.  Also, as the patient had evidence of a [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] on TEE, we refrained from DC or chemical cardioversion with procainamide especially since patient was stable on admission.  Instead the patient was started on an amiodarone drip with beta blockers in an attempt to control his rate.  Likely febrile illness and over treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis contributed to patient's a fib with rapid ventricular rate.  As the patient remained in a narrow complex tachycardia, the team felt comfortable using diltiazem for rate control in addition to beta blockers as his rate was not well controlled and the likelihood of him converting into a wide complex tachycardia was low.  His rate was eventually controlled on a diltiazem drip and the amiodarone was discontinued.  The patient then spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm with a wide QRS indicative of a right posterior\/inferior bypass tract consistent with WPW.  The diltiazem was discontinued and the patient was controlled on beta blockers alone. The patient was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation from the time of admission and coumadin was started during hospitalization.  The patient was discharged on propranolol, as there is a possibility thyrotoxicosis could have initially contributed to the A fib with RVR, and coumadin for management of his A fib.  He will be seen as an outpatient to discuss the possibility of ablation of the WPW bypass tract to prevent further episodes of wide complex tachycardia.  # [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]:  The patient presented with a TEE done at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital which showed evidence of a left atrial appendage thrombus.  Our TEE attending reviewed the echo and could not rule out the presence of a thrombus.  The patient was continued on a heparin drip during his hospitalization and started on coumadin.  A TTE was done which could not visualize the left atrial appendage, therefore could not rule out the presence of a thrombus.  A TEE was done here which showed no thrombus.  The patient was discharged on coumadin with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician for an INR check on Monday following discharge.  # Febrile Illness:  Fever, leukocytosis and productive cough likely secondary to respiratory illness.  As the patient has had cough, malaise and general body weakness flu was on differential, however ruled out during hospitalization.  The CXR on admission showed possible LLL and RLL infiltrate, thus the patient was started on doxycycline and ceftriaxone for CAP.  The patient also had a UA which showed possible evidence of a UTI however the urine culture was negative.  The patient was continued on ceftriaxone and doxycycline during hospitalization and discharged on cefpodoxime and doxycycline to complete a 10 day course.  # Hypertension:  Initially held antihypertensives in the setting of A fib with RVR with episode of hypotension at OSH in order to up-titrate beta blocker for control of AF as much as possible. Once the patient was stable on propranolol 80mg TID, lisinopril and triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide were restarted.  The patient was discharged on this regimen.  # Hyperlipidemia:  Lipids checked and were not elevated despite lack of statin therapy.  As had clean coronaries in [**2106**] no indication for statin.  # Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:  Pt's TSH at OSH was 0.07, however free T4 and T3 within normal limits.  TFTs here were similar. Consulted endocrine who said the patient was on too high of a replacement dose of levothyroxine.  They recommended adding levothyroxine 150mcg back once stable.  Discharged on this dose.   # Depression:  Continued sertraline.  # S\/P Gastric Banding:  Continued vitamin supplementation and diet restrictions.  # OSA:  Continued on home CPAP settings, pressure of 10, while inpatient.  # ACCESS: R IJ placed at [**Hospital1 1474**], confirmed placement with CXR. Was documented from OSH as sterile placement so was kept in place.  The line was pulled prior to discharge.  # CODE: Full Code  # Contact:  [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], sister, HCP, [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 65282**], [**Name2 (NI) 1743**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 56192**], fiance [**Telephone\/Fax (1) 65283**]   "}]
