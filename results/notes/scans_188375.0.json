EKG ([**2193-1-8**]): Sinus rhythm at the upper limits of normal rate. Right inferior axis. RSR' pattern in lead V1. Borderline intraventricular conduction delay. Low precordial voltage. Since the previous tracing of [**2192-5-8**] the inferior Q waves are less prominent now. Early precordial ST segment elevations are no longer present. Clinical correlation is suggested. . CXR ([**2193-1-8**]): Limited study with increased left basilar density, which may reflect atelectasis and effusion though pneumonia cannot be excluded. Correlation with lateral view may aid in diagnosis. . CXR ([**2193-1-9**]): In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there is again blunting of the left costophrenic angle with opacification at the base. Again, there is asymmetry of the density of the lungs with the left being somewhat darker. Mild prominence of interstitial markings persists that could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema. . TTE ([**2193-1-9**]): The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricleappears mildly dilated and hypokinetic. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Mild pulmonary artery systolic pressure hypertension.  "}]
