[**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2 transferred from OSH for continued management of heart failure. . Outside hospital course: Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **]hospital on [**10-6**] c\/o SOB, dry cough, and chest pressure. He was found in resp distress, hypoxic,  required Bipap initially and was found to have pH 7.23 PCO2 130 and PO2 134 and was subsequently intubated on hospital day 2. He was thought to be in CHF. BNP was 1680. Per report, he was started on lasix gtt and diuresed 5-7L in first 3 days of admission. He was thought to be overdiuresed with contraction alkalosis and bicarb peak of 62 and lasix was held.  Dopamine and levophed for pressure support. He was also noted to have clots coming from ET tube thought to result in transient atectasis of his left upper lung. Anticoagulation was held. He had a drop in platelets as low as 94 but recovered to 142 prior to baseline. Hct remained stable ~33. LFTs were WNL and cardiac enzymes were flat. INR was 3.8. . Echo was perfromed on OSH admission showed markedly elevated right sided pressures due to increased gradient throught the pulmonic and mitral valve and the presence of severe TR and possible VSD. PA pressures were calculated to close to 80mmHg. Bioprothetic MV looked well seated and no MR. Could not visualized PV but thought to exhibit increased transvalvular gradient to a moderately severe degree. . Vital signs prior to transfer: T 100.3 103 116\/38 91% vent on AC TV 300 FiOs 40% RR 14 Peep 5. . Review of systems could not be obtained [**1-5**] patient intubated and sedated.
