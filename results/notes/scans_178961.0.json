FINDINGS: Evaluation is limited due to diffuse bowel gas. Within these limitations, the liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities. There are gallstones, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis. Incidental note is made of several tiny probable cholesterol polyps. Pancreas is completely obscured by bowel gas. Spleen is not well visualized. The right kidney measures 11.4 cm, left kidney measures 13.8 cm. Though partially obscured by bowel gas, neither kidney shows evidence of stone or solid mass. Abdominal aorta is obscured by bowel gas. Main portal vein is patent, with appropriate antegrade flow.  IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to diffuse bowel gas. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.   DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5718**] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 177**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: WED [**2114-3-28**] 9:28 AM  Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium\/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium\/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 5719**] before surgical incision  POST-BYPASS:  Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine and milrinone. LVEF = 35%. RV function is normal. Mild mitral regurgitation present. Aorta is intact post decannulation. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware of post bypass findings.    I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance with HCFA regulations.
