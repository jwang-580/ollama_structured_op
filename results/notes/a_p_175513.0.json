[{"0":" Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 28 year old female with PMH of SLE, diagnosed in [**2109**] but untreated, who was transferred from OSH with fever, hypotension, tachycardia and pericardial effusion with evidence of early tamponade on admission ECHO.  She presented to an OSH after several syncopal episodes and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] when echocardiogram suggested pericardial effusion and tamponade.  At [**Hospital1 **], TTE confirmed early pericardail tamponade and a pericardiocentesis was performed wit drainage of 340cc of serous pericardial fluid.  Her pericardial effusion was exudative and was determined to be likely [**12-22**] her SLE.  She was started on prednisone and hydroxychloroquine for suspected SLE and autoimmune panel was ordered.  Her pericardial drain was removed the day after placement and she did well with no evidence of recurrance of her effusion.  She was initially treated with azithromycin and cefepime however these were discontinued on transfer to the floor as infectious workup was negative and fevers and leukocytosis were more likely associated was SLE flare and systemic inflammation. . 1)Pericardial effusion\/early tamoponade: s\/p percardiocestesis with removal of 340cc yellow fluid removed, exudative on analysis.  She tolerated removal of drain well with no hemodynamically consequent recurrance of her effusion.  She was treated with prednisone and hydroxychloroquine and slowly improved throughout her admission. She had a repeat ECHO on [**4-4**] prior to discharge which did not show any evidence of repeat effusion.  She was discharged with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic.  2)Cardiomyopathy: On echocardiogram she was noted to have global LV hypokinesis and systolic dysfunction with EF of 35% most likely due to lupus cardiomyopathy.  She was followed by rheumatology consultants who felt that her cardiomyopathy would likely resovle with treatment of her SLE as above.  She was treated with afterload reduction in the meantime with lisinopril.  She will follow up in cardiology clinic.  3)SLE: The patient reports receiving a dx of SLE in [**2109**], which she claims to have controlled with diet.  On presention, her symptoms and labs were c\/w an acute SLE flare and included amenorrhea, unintentional weight loss, fevers, fatigue, alopecia, sun sensitivity, xerostomia, sicca, and vaginal dryness.  She also reports frequent \"lumps\" under her chin, indicating possible enlarged salivary glands.  These symptoms are consistent with Sjogren's Syndrome, which is most frequently associated with RA but can also underlie other autoimmune conditions such as SLE. She had comprehensive lab work up that was consistent with a diagnosis of SLE including diminished C3, positive SSA, positive [**Doctor First Name **], pancytopenia, positive antigranulocyte antibodies, positive antiRNP antibodies, elevated IgG, IgM, and elevated RF.  She was treated with prednisone and hydroxychloroquine and will follow up in one week of discharge in lupus clinic.  4)Pancytopenia: Most likley [**12-22**] to her diagnosis of acute SLE flare.  She was followed by hematology during her admission. Blood titers for CMV, EBV, and parvovirus were negative.  She was treated with high dose folate.  5) Proteinuria:  She was evaluted by nephrology team due to concern for possible lupus nephritis given that she had proteinuria.  Her urine sediment was reviewed with no evidence of lupus nephritis.  Given her increased risk she will follow up in nephrology clinic for close monitoring of her renal function.   "}]
