feeling of tightness in his chest. This passed but he 
subsequently has had a daily feeling of crackles or rattling in 
his lungs when he breathes in the early morning. This weekend, 
he was playing tennis and felt short of breath while running. He 
attributed this to deconditioning but reports he continued to 
feel mildly dyspneic on exertion and thus decided to present to 
his outpatient oncologist.

RUQ ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS:  
The liver echotexture is normal. No concerning hepatic mass is 
detected. The main portal vein is patent, demonstrating proper 
hepatopetal flow. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation. 
The gallbladder is normal. The CBD is normal in caliber, 
measuring 3 mm. 
  
The pancreas is normal. There is no ascites. Included views of 
the IVC and aorta are within normal limits. The right and left 
kidneys measure 11.3 and 9.3 cm, respectively, without stone, 
mass, or hydronephrosis. The spleen is not enlarged, measuring 
10.5 cm. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Normal ultrasound appearance of the liver, gallbladder, and 
spleen. 

CXR ON ___
IMPRESSION: 
Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Multifocal mainly mid and 
lower lobe opacities are present on both PA and lateral view, 
with some peripheral and basal for disposition. There is no 
appreciable pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. 
  
The findings although potentially representing infectious 
process, can 
represent other etiologies for example cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia or drug reaction. Giving the patient history, further 
assessment with chest CT is required. There is no pneumothorax. 
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema 

CHEST CT ON ___
IMPRESSION:  
Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities predominantly in the lower 
lobes and at the periphery of the lungs, which may be seen with 
multifocal infection, such as a viral infection. In the setting 
of allogeneic bone marrow transplant and minimal patient 
symptoms, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, a diagnosis of 
exclusion, may be most likely in this situation. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Mr. ___ presented with dyspnea on 
exertion and findings on a CT of the Chest notable for diffuse 
bilateral opacities. Based on the imaging findings and his 
clinical status, the leading differential under consideration 
includes aspergillosis versus an organizing pneumonia, though 
atypical infectious etiologies such as a viral PNA or PCP are 
also being considered. Of note, he had discontinued prophylaxis 
with voriconazole about 3 weeks prior to this admission due to a 
transaminitis. He remained afebrile throughout the admission 
with an ambulatory oxygen saturation of 94%. He underwent a 
bronchoscopy on ___. Due to concern for aspergillosis as 
the cause of his symptoms, an ID Consult was requested. The 
patient had to leave the hospital before the ID recommendations 
could be finalized but their preliminary recommendation was that 
the patient be discharged on voriconazole 450 q12hrs X 1 day 
followed by 350mg q12hrs. They recommended this or another 
acceptable treatment for aspergillosis be continued until there 
is evidence of response or an alterative diagnosis had been 
identified. The biopsy results from his bronchoscopy were 
pending at the time of discharge. The Interventional Pulmonary 
Team recommended that Mr. ___ remain on lifelong prophylaxis 
for aspergillosis regardless of his final diagnosis.

#TRANSAMINITIS: Mr. ___ has had a transaminitis of uncertain 
etiology with an ALT and AST on this admission of 176 and 98, 
respectively. The differential for this problem may include GVHD 
of the liver, drug toxicity second to voriconazole or other 
biliary etiologies. Hepatology was consulted and recommended an 
abdominal ultrasound that showed a normal liver, gallbladder and 
spleen. Iron studies, Hepatitis labs and several Rheumatologic 
labs were ordered on their team's recommendation. Transaminitis 
downtrended without any intervention and on the day of discharge 
ALT was 101, AST was 43 and Alk Phos was 264. The plan was for 
Mr. ___ to follow-up on this problem in the outpatient 
___ clinic.

#MALE BREAST CANCER: Mr. ___ has male breast cancer ___ s/p 
mastectomy with a plan for tamoxifen. This was not started 
during his admission due to transaminitis.

#AML s/p alloBMT (day+261): Mr. ___ is s/p a matched related 
donor alloBMT for AML. While inpatient his Tacrolimus was 
continued at 0.5mg twice weekly (M/Th).  Acyclovir prophylaxis 
was also continued at 400mg q8hrs.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please follow-up bronchoscopy results including final BAL ___, 
galactomannan and Respiratory Viral Antigen Panel as well as 
final pulm tissue pathology
- Follow-up with ___ regarding appropriate 
- Plan to follow-up with Pulmonary regarding final results and 
treatment planning
- Plan to follow-up with Hepatology for further work-up of 
Transaminitis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with PMHx significant for 
MDS RAEB - 2, status post allogeneic stem cell transplant from 
matched related donor, currently D+120 with recent anemia 
requiring transfusion and bone marrow biopsy concerning for pure 
red cell aplasia as well as Afib not on coumadin who presents 
after presyncopal episode this morning. 

Pt states that this morning he was standing up in the kitchen 
when he began to feel lightheaded like he was going to faint. He 
noted flashes of color across his vision. This lasted for 
several minutes. No associated chest pain, palpitations, SOB or

movement. He went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement with 
relief of his symptoms. BM was large but nonbloody, no melena. 
No associated fever, chills, N/V, abdominal pain or diarrhea. 
Notes urine output in excess of intake over past several days 
with normal appetite. Only other recent symptom is nonproductive 
cough. No sick contacts or recent travel. Has been taking his 
medications as prescribed. He called his doctor and was 
instructed to come to the ED for evaluation. 

Of note, he was diagnosed with MDS in the setting of multifocal 
pneumonia and WBC count of 47. Bone marrow biopsy in ___ 
showed changes consistent with MDS RAEB -2. He is s/p 4 cycles 
of decitabine with a decrease from 10% to 7% blasts in his 
marrow and normalization of his WBC, which was initially 47k. He 
decided to proceed with an elective allo-transplant with a MRD 
___ match from his brother with a reduced-intensity 
non-myeloablative transplant with Flu/BU conditioning regimen 
with day 0 on ___. Over the last several months he has been 
noted to have persistent anemia with absence of red cell 
precursors consistent with pure red cell aplasia based on bone 
marrow biopsy. He was treated with transfusions requiring about 
a unit a week, most recently on ___. His cyclosporine was 
tapered until discontinuation on ___. During his most recent 
clinic visit with Dr. ___ on ___ plan had been to monitor 
for improvement in cell count after discontinuation of 
immunosuppression then consider pheresis and/or rituximab. He 
was also noted to have developed tingling and pruritus 
concerning for GVH of the skin soon after discontinuation of 
immunosuppression. He was treated with benedryl and hydroxyzine 
as an outpatient. 

On arrival to the ED, his initial VS were 98.7 86 104/69 16 99%. 
Orthostatics were negative. Initial workup revealed CBC w/ WBC 
2.3, hgb 4.9, hct 14, plt 84. Repeat CBC (prior to any 
intervention) showed WBC 3.9, Hgb 6.8, hct 19.4, plt 83. 
Hemolysis labs revealed normal INR, haptoglobin and LDH. LFTs 
were normal, Cr 1.2 (lower than recent baseline). Troponins were 
neg x 2. CXR was unremarkable. He was treated with 1L NS and 
given his home medications. Case discussed with ___ with 
recommendation for admission.

On arrival to the floor, pt denies any dizziness or

within normal limits

SKIN BIOPSY ___: Pauci-inflammatory interface dermatitis 
with patchy involvement of epidermis and mid-upper hair 
follicle, consistent with graft versus host disease in the 
appropriate clinical setting (see note).
Note: While less likely, a viral exanthem and drug reaction 
cannot be entirely excluded. This diagnosis was called to Dr. 
___ (Dermatology) by Dr. ___ on ___.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with past medical history 
significant for MDS RAEB - 2, status post allogeneic stem cell 
transplant from matched related donor in ___ with recent 
anemia requiring transfusion and bone marrow biopsy concerning 
for pure red cell aplasia who presents after presyncopal 
episode, found to be anemic so was admitted for further work-up 
and management of PRA now s/p treatment with several sessions of 
pheresis and Rituxan. He developed skin rash and diarrhea in the 
setting of immunosuppressant taper consistent with GVHD of the 
skin and gut treated with high dose steroids and restarting 
cyclosporine.

# GVHD of skin/GI tract: Pruritic papular rash on admission exam 
concerning for grade 2 GVHD given given clinical appearance of 
rash and biopsy in the setting stopping cyclosporine on ___. 
Rash resolved with steroids.  No ocular or liver involvement. 
Developed diarrhea the day after admission. Amount of liquid 
stool per day was consistent with grade I GVHD of the gut. C 
diff was neg x 2. GI symptoms initially improved with steroids 
and bowel rest and he was advanced from clear liquid to phase 3 
diet. On ___ he developed recurrent symptoms including 
abdominal cramping and loose stool so he returned to ___ 
steroids, budesonide and bowel rest. CT ___ without 
evidence of colitis but possible enteritis for which he was 
started on flagyl. Flex sigmoidoscopy was unremarkable, biopsies 
returned showing normal colonic mucosa. After his abdominal 
cramping and diarrhea had improved his diet was gradually 
re-advanced as per GVHD protocol. His cyclosporine levels were 
monitored with dosing adjustments as needed. He was discharged 
on stage IV diet with plans to advance to stage V ~ 1 week after 
discharge. 

# Anemia/Pure red cell aplasia: Slow count recovery after 
transplant followed by anemia requiring weekly blood transfusion 
in the last month prior to admission. Bone marrow biopsy in 
___ concerning for pure red cell aplasia, which he is at risk 
for given the ABO mismatch of his allogeneic bone marrow 
transplant. Admission labs revealed WBC of 3.9, Hgb 6.8 (from 
6.8-7.9) and plt 83 (from 140's in ___. Low Hgb as well as 
downward platelet trend consistent with PRA diagnosis. His 
cyclosporine had been tapered in the outpatient setting, 
prompting the GVHD as above, without significant improvement in 
his counts so it was restarted shortly after admission. He 
received a total of 4U PRBC (last ___ during this admission. 
Furthermore, he was treated with rituximab on ___ and 
then 6 sessions of plasmapheresis with improvement in his blood 
counts including retic count. 

# MDS/s/p MRD allo SCT: Pt was diagnosed with MDS in ___ now 
s/p 4 cycles of decitabine and MRD allo SCT in ___ (day >120 
on admission) with reduced intensity flu/bu. Recent WBC stable 
with persistent anemia and downtrending plts with pure red cell 
aplasia on bone marrow as above. Post-transplant course is now 
also complicated by GVHD of the skin and gut as above. 
Immunosuppression was restarted with cyclosporine during this 
admission. Ursodiol was discontinued due to diarrhea. 
Prophylaxis was continued with acyclovir, bactrim and 
voriconazole while on high dose steroids. Fungal ppx was 
switched to mycafungin several days prior to discharge secondary 
to elevated LFTS; he was discharged on IV mycafungin.

# Afib: History of atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation 
given low CHADS score and low platelets. On metoprolol and 
diltiazem for rate control at baseline. He remained in irregular 
rhythm on exam. Early in his hospital course he had several 
episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR that responded to an 
additional dose of PO diltiazem. Home diltiazem and metoprolol 
were continued. 

# Pre-syncopal episode: Episode of near-syncope on the morning 
of admission. Possibly vasovagal given urge to have BM versus 
hypovolemic given anemia and history of poor oral intake. 
Troponins were negative x 2 in the ED. CXR, UA, BCx and C diff 
were negative for infection. He was transfused as above and 
rehydrated with IVF with relief of symptoms.

# GERD: Possibly component of laryngospasm based on worsening of 
GERD in the setting of steroids. Home omeprazole was continued 
and ranitidine was initiated with good effect. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
# Cyclosporine dose at time of discharge: 50QAM, 25QPM
# Steroid dose at time of discharge: 45 mg daily, with plan for 
very slow taper
# Will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ on ___
# Discharged on mycafungin because LFTs were elevated in the 
setting of Voriconazole
# Plan for next rituxan dose ___
# ursodial was discontinued in the setting of diarrhea, which 
was subsequently believed to be GVHD: consider restarting in the 
future
# Metoprolol XL dose increased from 50 to 100 daily for better 
rate control during his hospitalization (had multiple episodes 
of Afib with RVR).Dose ___ need to be adjusted in the future

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history 
significant for MDS RAEB -2, status post allogeneic stem cell 
transplant from matched related donor in ___ (D+163) with 
recurrent anemia (?pure red cell aplasia) ___ pheresis and
rituximab, now on cyclosporine with likely skin and gut GVHD, 
re-presenting with pancytopenia, electrolyte 
disturbances(hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia) and 
hypotension at home. Diarrhea/hypotension resolved, issues now 
are
hyponatremia/SIADH and pancytopenia.

# hyponatremia/SIADH - urine lytes c/w SIADH, pt supposed to be
fluid restricted at home but in clinic due to c/f hypotension
received IVF and then drank 2L fluid the following day in form 
of
po contrast for CT. This likely precipitated sudden drop in Na.
Currently titrating fluid restriction based on sodiums checking
q6-8 hrs. Currently Na stable at 128 at 8am ___. No seizures or 
other
neurologic symptoms. 
- cont 1L fluid trial today
- will hold salt tabs for now

#Neutropenia/pancytopenia - unclear etiology. Neutropenia
improving and pt no longer neutropenic. No fevers at 
presentation or home. Pancytopenia likely secondary to red cell 
aplasia vs GVH involving marrow, vs sepsis, rituximab, 
cyclosporin, or TMP-SMX, vs viral infection (CMV, EBV, HHV6 
etc).
- stopped antibiotics ___
- monitor ___ daily
- f/u EBV VL (added on again today ___ was not sent), CMV VL
though recently not detected, parvo, HHV6, all pending

# Hypotension: Asymptomatic noted to be hypotensive to SBP 86 by 
___ at home. Here since arrival has never been hypotensive. Not 
clear he was having voluminous diarrhea either (seems small 
volume, and now resolved). Wonder if poor po intake in setting 
of dietary restrictions complicated by high doses of rate 
control
agents for his Afib which also have antihypertensive properties. 
EKG shows afib but no signs of ischemia. Ddx must include 
infection/sepsis in setting of immunocompromise though suspect 
less likely given pt without fevers. Initially given broad 
coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl but all abx DCd on ___ and 
no
further hypotension or fevers. Possibly related to viral process 
that self resolved and which could have contributed to his 
pancytopenia.
- cont micafungin, home med
- hold TMP-SMX due to pancytopenia, substituted atovaquone
- CT chest and abdomen with mild enteritis likely c/w what was
seen on prior CT during recent admit, sx resolving, no other
signs of infection on imaging
- bolus IV fluids as needed to maintain SBPs > 100  (has not
needed)
- blood, urine, and sputum cultures  
- consider repeating echo if hypotension develops again

# Diarrhea: Resolved completely per clinical history not severe, 
last 48 hours no true diarrhea/liquid stools. Sounds more c/w 
gas at home rather than large volume stool output. Differential 
includes recurrent GVHD not responding to current dose of
steroids versus infection. C-diff neg ___. Reent admit with 
severe diarrhea and GVH.
- decreased pred to 40mg daily from 45mg daily on ___
- continue cyclosporine at 100mg BID (levels 130, will titrate
per oncology attending targets)
-CSA level 133 on ___

# Recurrent anemia/pure red cell aplasia: Current Hct levels are 
likely at his baseline. Prior hematocrits around 28 could 
represent a degree of hemoconcentration with concurrent 
creatinines also above baseline (elevated to 1.1 at that time,
baseline 0.8-0.9). No evidence of acute bleeding or hemolysis. 
Last admission, he was treated with rituximab and 6 sessions of 
plasmapheresis with improvement in his blood counts including 
retic count until now.  
- T&S  
- trend Hgb/Hct, tsf for ___
- consider repeat bone marrow biopsy per Oncology team  
- f/u parvovirus B-19, other viral studies as above 

# Electrolyte disturbances: Resolved ___ repletion. 
Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia most likely secondary to possible 
diarrhea/frequent bowel movements at home. Hypocalcemia work-up 
will require a recent albumin and PTH check. Control of the
diarrhea should help with maintain normal electrolyte 
levels,?infectious vs. gut GVHD.  
- aggressive repletion of magnesium and potassium prn
 
# GVHD of skin/GI tract: Previously in setting of stopping 
cyclosporine on ___. Recently increased dosing yesterday due to 
low trough levels (50s), now at 100mg BID. Currently no active 
skin lesions.
- see management of diarrhea above decreased pred as above
- trough in 130 range

# MDS ___ MRD allo SCT: Diagnosed with MDS in ___ now ___ 4 
cycles of decitabine and MRD allo SCT in ___ (day >120 on 
admission) with reduced intensity flu/bu. Fungal ppx with IV 
micafungin (LFT elevation with voriconazole & fluconazole)  
- will monitor cytopenias as above 
 
# Atrial fibrillation: Not on anticoagulation given low CHADS 
score and low platelets.  
- home dilt and metoprolol in short acting form with holding 
parameters
- can consider repeating echo

currently maintained on 5mg prednisone daily and budesonide. He 
was diagnosed with aspergillus and stenotrophomonas pneumonia on 
BAL on ___ and treated with levofloxacin and voriconazole, 
and then on ___ was started on posaconizole for fungal 
prophylaxis. On ___ he was found to have citrobacter 
bacteremia from a suspected line infection and treated with 
meropenem, then cefepime, and finally ciprofloxacin for a 2 week 
course. On ___ he was admitted with afib with RVR and found to 
have Nocardia nova pneumonia of RLL diagnosed on lung biopsy and 
treated with imipenim and minocycline, which on ___ was switched 
to ceftriaxone/minocycline for dosing convenience when he was 
leaving rehab. On ___ minocycline and posaconazole were held 
due to elevated LFTs. He has been at ___ since his 
discharge on ___ with a planned discharge this week.  

He was seen by Dr. ___ in ___ clinic today and endorsed 
dyspnea on exertion and generally feeling weak. He was noted to

*IMAGING*

___ CT Chest WO Contrast
New opacity in the right upper right middle and right lower lobe 
has been
demonstrated with bronchus centric appearance and parenchymal 
involvement
concerning for extensive infectious process.  The findings have 
evidence of
air bronchogram as well as ground-glass opacities.  The 
pre-existing right
lower lobe nodule consistent with known or cardia pneumonia 
appears to be
unchanged in size.

___HEST
Substantial interval improvement of the multifocal opacities 
throughout the
right lung with minimal residual ground-glass, can be treated 
infection.
 
Stable right lower lobe nodular opacity, biopsy-proven Nocardia.
 
Ascending thoracic aorta top-normal size, unchanged.  Mild 
enlargement, main
and right pulmonary arteries, significance indeterminate.

___ LUE VENOUS ULTRASOUND 
Partially occlusive thrombus involving the left axillary and 
left basilic vein
along side a left-sided PICC.

___ ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is 
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular 
diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate 
(___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space 
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
right ventricular size is normal on current images. There is 
less tricuspid rigurgitation. Other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ MDS RAEB type 2, s/p RI-allo-MRD-HSCT admitted for HCAP, 
course complicated by a-fib with RVR, hyperuricemia, and ___. 
Course also notable for orthostatic hypotension, LUE 
PICC-associated DVT.

# HCAP: He presented to clinic with several days of dyspnea at 
___, and found to have new RUL consolidation on CXR. 
He has a history of pulmonary aspergillosis and stenotrophomonas 
pneumonia, as well as recent nocardia nova pneumonia diagnosed 
on lung biopsy. He was started on vancomycin, imipenem, 
ambisome, and levofloxacin with improvement in his symptoms. A 
bronchoscopy was attempted on ___ but was postponed due to 
development of a-fib with RVR. It was eventually performed on 
___ and BAL cultures grew stenotrophomonas. Repeat CT chest 
showed interval improvement in multi-focal consolidations. On 
___ he was narrowed to Ceftriaxone/levofloxacin/posaconazole out 
of concern for medication leading to cytopenias (see below). His 
cough and dyspnea and resolved at discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient has chronic atrial 
fibrillation per Atrius records, and was previously treated with 
digoxin which was discontinued due to toxicity. He is currently 
on high dose metoprolol and diltiazem at home. Following 
admission, he developed atrial fibrillation with RVR and 
hypotension to SBP high ___. This did resolve with short acting 
nodal blockade. He was started on digoxin. He remained in a-fib 
and rates gradually improved to ___. Digoxin was 
discontinued due to ___ as well as history of digoxin toxicity. 
He is unable to be anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia. As 
below, his metop/dilt doses were downtitrated due to orthostatic 
hypotension.

#Orthostatic hypotension: Towards the end of his course he 
developed orthostatic hypotension which was intermittently 
symptomatic. This was likely multifactorial, related to 
overdiuresis and high doses of metoprolol and diltiazem. This 
gradually improved with holding Lasix and slight decreases in 
doses of metop/dilt.  To rule out other causes of hypotension, 
we checked an AM cortisol which was normal pointing against 
adrenal insufficiency, and he had an ECHO which was unchanged 
from prior.  

#LUE PICC-associated DVT: On ___ he developed swelling in his 
left hand. Ultrasound of the LUE showed partially occlusive 
thrombus associated with his left antecubital PICC. Swelling 
resolved w/elevation of the left arm. His PICC was left in place 
in light very difficult access in this patient and poor wound 
healing making tunneled line or port suboptimal. He was started 
on a lower dose of enoxaparin (30 mg subQ daily) because his 
platelets were in the ___ on ___. There ws no evidence of 
bleeding.  PICC worked well throughout. 

#Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: Initially required diuresis 
with IV Lasix. Lasix was subsequently held from ___ in 
setting of orthostatic hypotension, then restarted ___ given 
weight gain and lower extremity swelling. At discharge he had 2+ 
___ edema. 

#Pancytopenia: Course notable for worsening pancytopenia. As 
below he underwent BM biopsy ___ which showed 100% donor cells. 
This was thought most likely a side effect of his antibiotics, 
and cytopenias did stabilize after swtiching to ceftriaxone on 
___.  EBV and CMV were sent to r/o viral cause, and these were 
negative.

# MDS with ___ with Excess Blasts Type II: s/p 
reduced intensity allo MRD SCT D+405 on admission. His course is 
complicated by pure red cell aplasia, improved with rituximab 
and pheresis, and GVHD of gut. He continued on prednisone 5mg;  
budesonide was stopped and stools were closely monitored - in 
part in an effort to reduce patient's steroid load given very 
poor wound healing. Bone marrow biopsy in clinic on ___ showed 
100% donor cells. For his hypogammaglobulinemia, he received 
IVIG 40mg on ___, 10mg on ___, 10 mg on ___. 

# ___: His baseline creatinine is normal, but creatinine 
worsened to 1.7. This was felt to be due to congestive 
nephropathy, and improved with diuresis.
